To do the Bonus Task 1, I compute the distance between a mispelled word and a trie.

For the initialization step, I simply create a trie and put all words in the dictionary into the trie.
Each trie node has a character(letter), a word(None if invalid), a parent, and a set of subsequent letter nodes

To compute the distance between the word and the trie, the process is just like filling in the distance table
row by row. For the last distance value for a given row, if the distance is in the given range and the trie node
in process contains a valid word, then we will add this word into the result list. At last, we just sort the list, and get the word with the least edit distance.
