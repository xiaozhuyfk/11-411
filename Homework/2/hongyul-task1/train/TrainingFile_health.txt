" Pixel tracking " , a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites , involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding .

This allows us to speed up your future activities , saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration . In addition , Blizzard may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional , marketing , or security purposes . Blizzard and our third-party tracking service also employ a software technology called clear gifs ( a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs ) , that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective . Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier , similar in function to cookies , and are used to track the online movements of Web users . In contrast to cookies , which are stored on a user 's computer hard drive , clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence . These clear gifs are not tied to personally identifiable information . Our third-party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate . They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our Web site . We have no access or control of these third-party tracking utilities . We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients . This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns . For this reason , these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information . An Internet protocol ( " IP " ) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ( " ISP " ) . Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration , to report aggregate information , site tracking , security purposes , or to prevent our servers from being abused . If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information , or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information , please contact Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy , Attention : Privacy Policy Administrator , at 16215 Alton Pkwy . Irvine CA 92618-3616 . You can also contact us by e-mailing us at privacy @ blizzard.com . We will respond to any request for access within 30 days . In some cases , we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations , resolve disputes , and enforce our agreements .

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY . IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS . Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com . In the unlikely event that EA can not resolve a concern to your satisfaction ( or if EA can not resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally ) , then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us . This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law , but expressly excludes residents of Quebec , Russia , Switzerland , the Member States of the European Union , and the Republic of Korea . By accepting these terms , you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action . This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly . This Section covers any and all disputes between us ( " Disputes " ) , including without limitation :  - claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us , whether based in contract , tort , statute , fraud , misrepresentation or any other legal theory ; - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ( including , but not limited to , claims relating to advertising ) ; - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class ; and - claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement . The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following :  - a claim to enforce or protect , or concerning the validity of , any of your or EA 's ( or any of EA 's licensors ' ) intellectual property rights ; - a claim related to , or arising from , allegations of theft , piracy , or unauthorized use ; - In addition , nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action . References to " EA , " " you , " and " us " include our respective subsidiaries , affiliates , agents , employees , predecessors in interest , successors , and assigns , as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us . This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce , and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision . This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service . A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute . You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration . Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ( " Notice of Dispute " ) . Notices of Dispute must : ( a ) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party ; ( b ) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and ( c ) set forth the specific relief sought ( " Demand " ) . EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address ( if you provided it to us ) or to the email address you provided to us . You will send your Notice of Dispute to : Electronic Arts Inc. , 209 Redwood Shores Parkway , Redwood City CA 94065 , ATTENTION : Legal Department . B. Binding Arbitration . If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute , either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration . Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION , YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL . The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) and , where appropriate , the AAA 's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ( AAA Consumer Rules ) , both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org . Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and , where appropriate , limited by the AAA Consumer Rules . If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive , or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration , then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses . The arbitration may be conducted in person , through the submission of documents , by phone or online . The arbitrator will make a decision in writing , and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party . The arbitrator must follow applicable law , and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so . You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration , to stay proceeding pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . C. Restrictions . You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually . To the full extent permitted by law , ( 1 ) no arbitration shall be joined with any other ; ( 2 ) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures ; and ( 3 ) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons . YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY , AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING . Further , unless both you and EA agree otherwise , the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person 's claims , and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable , then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void . D. Location . If you are a resident of the United States , arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you . For residents outside the United States , arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo , State of California , United States of America , and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court , in order to compel arbitration , to stay proceedings pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . E. Recovery and Attorneys ' Fees . If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA 's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator , then EA will :  - Pay you 150 % of your arbitration award , up to $ 5,000 over and above your arbitration award ; and - Pay your attorney , if any , the amount of attorneys ' fees , and reimburse any expenses ( including expert witness fees and costs ) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating , preparing , and pursuing your claim in arbitration ( " the attorney premium " ) . The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees , expenses , and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . The right to attorneys ' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys ' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law , although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys ' fees or costs . EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us . F. Limitation on Arbitrator 's Authority . The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party 's individual claim . G. Changes to This Provision . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary , we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision ( other than a change to the Notice Address ) , you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above .

This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service . A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute . You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration . Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ( " Notice of Dispute " ) . Notices of Dispute must : ( a ) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party ; ( b ) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and ( c ) set forth the specific relief sought ( " Demand " ) .

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and , where appropriate , limited by the AAA Consumer Rules . If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive , or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration , then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses . The arbitration may be conducted in person , through the submission of documents , by phone or online . The arbitrator will make a decision in writing , and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party . The arbitrator must follow applicable law , and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so . You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration , to stay proceeding pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . C.

YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY , AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING . Further , unless both you and EA agree otherwise , the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person 's claims , and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable , then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void . D. Location .

E. Recovery and Attorneys ' Fees . If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA 's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator , then EA will :  - Pay you 150 % of your arbitration award , up to $ 5,000 over and above your arbitration award ; and - Pay your attorney , if any , the amount of attorneys ' fees , and reimburse any expenses ( including expert witness fees and costs ) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating , preparing , and pursuing your claim in arbitration ( " the attorney premium " ) . The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees , expenses , and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . The right to attorneys ' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys ' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law , although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys ' fees or costs . EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us . F. Limitation on Arbitrator 's Authority . The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party 's individual claim .

We are especially careful in any communications with children under the age of 13 ( " Child " or " Children " ) . Ubisoft restricts access to certain Services on age grounds and , in certain jurisdictions , for certain Services and functions , asks for parent approval when a Child wishes to register for the Services . When we intend to collect personal information from a Child , we take additional steps to protect children 's privacy , including : Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children , including the types of personal information we may collect from Children , the uses to which we may put that information , and whether and with whom we may share that information In accordance with applicable law , obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their Children , or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted More specifically , when a Child under the age of 13 registers , ( s ) he must supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian who will be contacted by Ubisoft to ask him/her to confirm , refuse to modify his/her Minor 's registration . Ubisoft reserves the right to limit the period during which a child under the age of 13 may play pending confirmation and activation by his/her parent or guardian . Ubisoft reserves the right to ask for written proof of parental consent for any user or potential user of the services suspected to be a Child . Parental consent applies exclusively to the specific service for which it has been granted . Certain Services are specifically designed for Children and enable Children under the age of 13 to create their own free accounts for which Ubisoft collects their username , password , date of birth ( or age ) , country , and parent or guardian 's e-mail address . Such services sometimes offer the possibility of paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable Children to participate in more activies on the Services by making a payment . The subscription services may also allow parents or guardians to manage their Child 's account and create their own player accounts . Certain services enable Children to create personalized avatars which they can use in numerous activies in the services , including mini-games and virtual worlds . Children may also use other functions of the Services such as " Recommend to a friend " to invite a friend to find out about the servies . The " Recommend to a friend " functions enable Children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the related service . Ubisoft will collect the first name and e-mail address of your Child ( or , failing that , the e-mail address of the parent or guardian ) and the e-mail address of his/her friend for the sole purpose of sending a single message . This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we do not reveal your child 's e-mail address to the recipient . Parents may delete their Child 's Account or change their Child 's privacy settings at any time by creating a parental Account or by sending an e-mail to the administrator of the Privacy Policy , who is identified below . In all cases , use of the Services by Children must take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them . AS FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGISLATION , UBISOFT DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE CONDUCTED BY CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS . IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU GIVE YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OR OTHER OF THE SERVICES , YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR CHILD . A6 . The services may contain links to other websites . For instance , purchases of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for Ubisoft Services may be transacted on a third party processors site . Any personal information you provide on linked pages or applications is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party 's privacy policy . This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites , and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other sites that are linked to or from the Services . We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information . A7 .

Please send your revocation to the email address indicated below . No other costs shall be incurred for a revocation apart from the costs of transmitting such revocation . f ) Payment processing You will have to supply additional information when making a payment and the type of data depends on the kind of payment method you have selected . TRAVIAN GAMES offers a range of anonymous payment methods . TRAVIAN GAMES will forward the data required to process the payment to the service providers responsible for collecting the payment . TRAVIAN GAMES will assign TG Payment GmbH in Munich ( Germany ) to provide such payment services . Collaboration with third parties also involves payment processing via external service providers ( PayPal , credit card companies , mobile network operators , etc. ) . These third parties are legally bound to manage your personal data in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with prevailing legislation and may only use your personal data to fulfill their contractual obligations . When you initiate a payment during the game , a cookie will be set that contains a randomly generated ID number . This cookie will be required to return you to the game once the payment process has been completed . TRAVIAN GAMES employs persons responsible for ensuring the correct implementation of the payment processing is adhered to and who can therefore access any information required to do so . Such employees act exclusively in accordance with the stipulations and instructions of TRAVIAN GAMES and are tasked in particular with ensuring compliance with prevailing data protection regulations . Such employees use anonymized payment data to detect and prevent any misuse of the payment processes . In the event of a violation , the payment process will be canceled . In addition , TRAVIAN GAMES reserves the right to use the available data to implement further measures and to potentially merge it with other personal data . TRAVIAN GAMES is entitled to provide data to third parties to whom receivables due to TRAVIAN GAMES from the user have been assigned or to third parties who are responsible for collecting payment to the extent required to fulfill the collection of the receivables or the collection of the charges . In certain cases TRAVIAN GAMES will forward your personal data to the following third parties : Payment providers ( see above ) IT service providers ( e.g. email providers , host providers ) Database services ( e.g. analysis of advertising campaigns ) Associated companies ( e.g. payment data to TG Payment GmbH ) State agencies ( e.g. investigating authorities ) Such third parties are legally bound to manage your personal data in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with prevailing legislation and can only access your personal data if such data is required to fulfill their contract , respectively there is a legal basis for such access .

The above sections describe in more detail how TRAVIAN GAMES uses web beacons . c ) Social plug-ins TRAVIAN GAMES uses social plug-ins on its websites and games such as Facebook 's Like button or Facebook Connect and Google 's Google +1 button . A shared feature of social plug-ins is that when you access a TRAVIAN GAMES website that uses a social plug-in , the same data will be forwarded to the social plug-in provider that would be forwarded if you accessed the provider 's website directly . So for example when you call up a provider website that has Facebook 's Like button embedded , Facebook will receive your IP address , the browser version and screen resolution and the operating system of the device you have used to access the site and the URL of the website containing the Like button . This applies even if you have used none of the services offered by such providers . If the plug-in has been provided by Facebook or Google , the abovementioned data will be transferred to the USA .

Depending on the Promotion , we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and , depending on the Information collected , the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement . We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party 's interception of messages or a user 's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device . Users that register for GameTrailers ' wireless marketing services acknowledge , understand and agree that they will be charged by the user 's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from GameTrailers . Standard messaging rates will apply , unless noted otherwise . Under no circumstances will the Site , GameTrailers , its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user 's wireless device , telephone number , or email address . a . Registration . To the extent we provide wireless marketing services , there are two registration methods provided for GameTrailers ' wireless marketing services . Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the " single opt-in " or the " double-opt-in " ( Site/SMS ) method , at the discretion of GameTrailers depending on the type of Promotion . Premium rate services will require the " double opt-in " ( Site/SMS or SMS/SMS ) method . i . Single Opt-in Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted . The user 's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to GameTrailers will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to GameTrailers to send text messages to him or her . GameTrailers will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a " Thank you " message . The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from GameTrailers or by sending a text message to GameTrailers that says " STOP " , " END " , " CANCEL " , " REMOVE " , " UNSUBSCRIBE " or " QUIT " . ii . Double Opt-in ( Site/SMS ) Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process . The user must affirmatively consent to GameTrailers ' sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number ( or wireless email address , only if requested by GameTrailers ) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site 's registration page . The user must also agree to the Site 's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed . GameTrailers will then send a " Confirmation " message to the user 's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number ( or wireless domain name when appropriate ) . The user must respond to the " Confirmation " message with a text message that states " YES " or " Y " that will indicate the user 's acceptance of GameTrailers ' wireless marketing service . Until the user responds to the " Confirmation " message , the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion . A user may respond to the " Confirmation " message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user 's response to the " Confirmation " is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service . iii . Double Opt-in ( SMS/SMS ) Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted . GameTrailers will then send a " Confirmation " message to the user 's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number ( or wireless domain name when appropriate ) . The user must respond to the " Confirmation " message with a text message that states " YES " or " Y " that will indicate the user 's acceptance of GameTrailers ' wireless marketing service . Until the user responds to the " Confirmation " message , the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion . A user may respond to the " Confirmation " message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user 's response to the " Confirmation " is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service . b . Termination of Wireless Services by User . Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register , users may revoke their consent to receive messages from GameTrailers by the following procedure :  A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by GameTrailers at the time the message is sent , or by sending a text message that says " STOP " , " END " , " CANCEL " , " REMOVE " , " UNSUBSCRIBE " or " QUIT " . GameTrailers will terminate the user 's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user . Any of these words followed by the word " ALL " in the user 's termination request will cancel all of the user 's registered wireless services with GameTrailers . If the user unsubscribes from one or all of GameTrailers service ( s ) via his or her wireless device , the service ( s ) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user 's previous opt-in . c . Termination of Wireless Services by GameTrailers . A user understands , acknowledges and agrees that GameTrailers may , in its sole discretion and without liability to any user , terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice . GameTrailers may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site . d . Use of Information .

It also relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us online , on mobile or on the Red Button service . In order to provide you with the full range of BBC services , we sometimes need to collect information about you . This Privacy Policy explains the following :  what information the BBC may collect about you ; how the BBC will use information we collect about you ; when the BBC may use your details to contact you ; whether the BBC will disclose your details to anyone else ; your choices regarding the personal information you provide to us ; the use of cookies on BBC websites and how you can reject these cookies . The BBC is committed to safeguarding your personal information . Whenever you provide such information , we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information , including the Data Protection Act 1998 ( these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the " data protection laws " ) . BBC websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties . These third party websites have their own privacy policies , and are also likely to use cookies , and we therefore urge you to review them . They will govern the use of personal information you submit , which may also be collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites . We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk . The BBC is the largest broadcasting organisation in the world . We are a public service broadcaster , established by a Royal Charter and primarily funded by the licence fee that is paid by UK households . The BBC includes the BBC World Service , which broadcasts to the world on radio , on TV and online , providing news and information in 32 languages . It is funded by a government grant , not from the licence fee . The BBC also has a commercial arm , BBC Worldwide Limited and its group companies ( BBC Worldwide ) . BBC Worldwide is a wholly owned subsidiary and returns its profits to the BBC for investment in new programming and services . Amongst other activities , BBC Worldwide operates the international , advertising-funded version of the BBC website , bbc.com , for users from outside of the UK . BBC Worldwide 's activities are only covered by this Privacy Policy in relation to its use of any personal information collected on bbc.com . To find out more about BBC Worldwide , its commercial operations and how it will use personal information collected when you use its other international and UK services , please see its corporate website and the BBC Worldwide Privacy Policy . When we refer to ' we " or ' our " or ' the BBC " we are referring to the BBC , the BBC World Service and BBC Worldwide ( but only in relation to BBC Worldwide 's use of information collected via bbc.com ) . When you participate in , access or sign up to any of the BBC 's services , activities or online content , such as newsletters , competitions , live chats , message boards , telephone or text the BBC , vote , donate money to a BBC charity appeal , book tickets for a BBC event or create an account using the BBC 's online registration system we may receive personal information about you . This can consist of information such as your name , email address , postal address , telephone or mobile number or date of birth , depending on the activity . By submitting your details , you enable the BBC ( and where applicable its contractors ) to provide you with the services , activities or online content you select . Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information , and sometimes sensitive personal information ( e.g. if you 're sending in an application to be a contributor on a political party we may need to know your political leanings ) . When we do this we will provide further information as to why we are collecting your information and how we will use it . The BBC also uses cookies ( see section 13 below for details ) and collects IP addresses ( an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet ) from visitors to BBC websites . The BBC will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following : to provide our services , activities or online content and to deal with your requests and enquiries ; for " service administration purposes " , which means that the BBC may contact you for reasons related to the service , activity or online content you have signed up for , as set out in section 5 below ( e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service , activity or online content has been suspended for maintenance ) ; to contact you about a submission you have made , including any content you provide . For additional information , please see the UGC FAQS ( User Generated Content Frequently Asked Questions ) ; to provide you with information about our services , activities or online content ; to personalise the way BBC content is presented to you ( e.g. if the first thing you look at every day on the BBC website is the weather for Luton , we may present this information or a link to it on your homepage ) ; to use IP addresses to identify the location of users , to block disruptive use , to establish the number of visits from different countries and to determine whether you are accessing the services from the UK or not . If not , you will be re-directed to the international version of the BBC website ( bbc.com ) , ( see section 12 for details ) ; to analyse and improve the services offered on BBC websites ; to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience . The BBC may also use and disclose information in aggregate ( so that no individuals are identified ) for marketing and strategic development purposes ; and when you access the BBC website from outside the UK , you will see the international version ( bbc.com ) which features advertising . A certain amount of this advertising is tailored to the individual user . BBC Worldwide uses cookies to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the pages you look at on the international version of the BBC website and other BBC Worldwide sites , and your IP address information . This is a practice widely used by other major web publishers and is known as onsite behavioural targeting . The tracking system is anonymised and therefore it does not know who you are : it simply uses the limited information available to it to serve ads to you , if you are accessing the BBC website from outside the UK , which it believes are relevant . Find out more about BBC Worldwide 's use of its behavioural targeting system in the international users section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website . It is important to remember that you will only see this advertising , and receive Behavioural Targeted Marketing cookies , if you are visiting bbc.com from outside the UK . Where the BBC proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first . You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for the use of your personal information for purposes other than those listed above . The BBC may contact you : in relation to any service , activity or online content you have signed up for in order to ensure that the BBC can deliver the services to you ; in relation to any correspondence we receive from you or any comment or complaint you make about BBC products or services ; in relation to any contribution you have submitted to the BBC , e.g. on the BBC message boards or via text or voicemail message ; to invite you to participate in surveys about the BBC services ( participation is always voluntary ) ; and for marketing purposes , where you have agreed to this ( see section 6 below )  Local pages will give you detailed information about how the BBC will contact you in relation to specific services , activities or online content . The BBC will only use your information for marketing purposes , or to promote new services , activities or online content where you have agreed to this . We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law ( for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies ) or as described in section 8 below . Generally , we will only use your information within the BBC . However , sometimes the BBC uses third parties to process your information on our behalf . The BBC requires these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and the BBC requires that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes , unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way . If you post or send offensive , inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to BBC websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any BBC service , the BBC may use your personal information to stop such behaviour . Where the BBC reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws ( e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory ) , the BBC may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer , school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour . If you are aged 16 or under , please get your parent/guardian 's permission before you provide any personal information to the BBC . Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information . We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity , or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with the BBC or the BBC 's corporate retention schedule ( a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how long ) . If you cancel your registration as a BBC website member and your account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and , while the BBC can not use the personal information , it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically . Where you contribute material to the BBC we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose ( s ) for which it was submitted . For example , we will only keep copies of entries to a photographic competition for the duration of the competition . However other projects ( e.g. the People 's War website ) are likely to have a longer , or even permanent , duration . The BBC , as a publicly funded organisation , also has an obligation to record snapshots of history which may include some User Generated Content i.e. content provided by the public . Therefore , some content submitted to , or shared with , the BBC may be retained for prolonged periods of time or potentially indefinitely in the BBC 's Archive , which is true of News contributions which are published . There may also be rare instances where we will share your contribution with third parties in the interests of maintaining historical archives ( e.g. contributions about people 's experiences in the Second World War were given to the Imperial War Museum ) . Where possible , we will endeavour to inform you upfront or let you know at a later date where we are likely to keep content indefinitely or pass it onto an approved historical archive . Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information the BBC holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected . ( We charge 10 for information requests and require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification ) . We will use reasonable efforts to supply , correct or delete personal information about you on our files .

The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students , grades 6 to 12 . Within this section , the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor , providing their first name , grade , state/country and , optionally , their e-mail address . The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities , and is not shared or sold to third parties . If an e-mail address is provided , it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child . After responding to the child , the e-mail address is deleted . Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services . Because we 're concerned about a parent 's right to consent to the collection and use of their child 's personal information , when a question or letter is published , only the student 's first name , grade and state/country appear on the site . To request removal of this information ( non-personally identifiable ) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address ( personal information collected ) , please use this form to contact the Learning Network .

Privacy Policy Last modified : December 20 , 2013 ( view archived versions ) There are many different ways you can use our services - to search for and share information , to communicate with other people or to create new content . When you share information with us , for example by creating a Google Account , we can make those services even better - to show you more relevant search results and ads , to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier . As you use our services , we want you to be clear how we 're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy . Our Privacy Policy explains :  What information we collect and why we collect it . How we use that information . The choices we offer , including how to access and update information . We 've tried to keep it as simple as possible , but if you 're not familiar with terms like cookies , IP addresses , pixel tags and browsers , then read about these key terms first . Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user , please do take the time to get to know our practices - and if you have any questions consult this page . Information we collect We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak , to more complex things like which ads you 'll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online . We collect information in two ways :  Information you give us . For example , many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account . When you do , we 'll ask for personal information , like your name , email address , telephone number or credit card . If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer , we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile , which may include your name and photo . Information we get from your use of our services . We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them , like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content . This information includes :  Device information We may collect device-specific information ( such as your hardware model , operating system version , unique device identifiers , and mobile network information including phone number ) . Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account . Log information When you use our services or view content provided by Google , we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs . This may include :  details of how you used our service , such as your search queries . telephony log information like your phone number , calling-party number , forwarding numbers , time and date of calls , duration of calls , SMS routing information and types of calls . Internet protocol address . device event information such as crashes , system activity , hardware settings , browser type , browser language , the date and time of your request and referral URL. cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account . Location information When you use a location-enabled Google service , we may collect and process information about your actual location , like GPS signals sent by a mobile device . We may also use various technologies to determine location , such as sensor data from your device that may , for example , provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers . Unique application numbers Certain services include a unique application number . This number and information about your installation ( for example , the operating system type and application version number ) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers , such as for automatic updates . Local storage We may collect and store information ( including personal information ) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage ( including HTML 5 ) and application data caches . Cookies and anonymous identifiers We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service , and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device . We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners , such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites . How we use information we collect We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide , maintain , protect and improve them , to develop new ones , and to protect Google and our users . We also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more relevant search results and ads . We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account . In addition , we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services . If other users already have your email , or other information that identifies you , we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information , such as your name and photo . When you contact Google , we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing . We may use your email address to inform you about our services , such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements . We use information collected from cookies and other technologies , like pixel tags , to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services . For example , by saving your language preferences , we 'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer . When showing you tailored ads , we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories , such as those based on race , religion , sexual orientation or health . We may combine personal information from one service with information , including personal information , from other Google services - for example to make it easier to share things with people you know . We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent . We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy . Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world . We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live . Transparency and choice People have different privacy concerns . Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect , so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used . For example , you can :  Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard . View and edit your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and across the web , such as which categories might interest you , using Ads Settings . You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here . Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals . Control who you share information with . Take information out of many of our services . You may also set your browser to block all cookies , including cookies associated with our services , or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us . However , it 's important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled . For example , we may not remember your language preferences . Information you share Many of our services let you share information with others . Remember that when you share information publicly , it may be indexable by search engines , including Google . Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content . Accessing and updating your personal information Whenever you use our services , we aim to provide you with access to your personal information . If that information is wrong , we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes . When updating your personal information , we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request . We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive , require disproportionate technical effort ( for example , developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice ) , risk the privacy of others , or would be extremely impractical ( for instance , requests concerning information residing on backup systems ) . Where we can provide information access and correction , we will do so for free , except where it would require a disproportionate effort . We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction . Because of this , after you delete information from our services , we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems . Information we share We do not share personal information with companies , organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies :  With your consent We will share personal information with companies , organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so . We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information . With domain administrators If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator ( for example , for Google Apps users ) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information ( including your email and other data ) . Your domain administrator may be able to :  view statistics regarding your account , like statistics regarding applications you install . change your account password . suspend or terminate your account access . access or retain information stored as part of your account . receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law , regulation , legal process or enforceable governmental request . restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings . Please refer to your domain administrator 's privacy policy for more information . For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us , based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures . For legal reasons We will share personal information with companies , organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access , use , preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to :  meet any applicable law , regulation , legal process or enforceable governmental request . enforce applicable Terms of Service , including investigation of potential violations . detect , prevent , or otherwise address fraud , security or technical issues . protect against harm to the rights , property or safety of Google , our users or the public as required or permitted by law . We may share aggregated , non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners - like publishers , advertisers or connected sites . For example , we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services . If Google is involved in a merger , acquisition or asset sale , we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy . Information security We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration , disclosure or destruction of information we hold . In particular :  We encrypt many of our services using SSL . We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account , and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome . We review our information collection , storage and processing practices , including physical security measures , to guard against unauthorized access to systems . We restrict access to personal information to Google employees , contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us , and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations .

For more information about cookies and managing them , including how to turn them off , please visit our page on Cookies . By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described . In late 2005 we launched a new advertising service called online behavioural advertising ( OBA ) . OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to people who visit our website . It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site . It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you . As you browse our sites , some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies , so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in We can then display advertising on your browser that is based on these perceived interests . For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles , you may be shown more adverts for food and drink . It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we use will collect information such as your name , email address , postal address or phone number . We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners . This may mean that when you are on other websites , you will be shown advertising based on your behaviour on theguardian.com . We may also show you advertising on our site based on your behaviour on other sites . Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites . For example , if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop , you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing . This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase . The privacy policy of criteo , one of the partners that we work with for behavioural retargeting is shown here . criteo.com/en/privacy-policy . If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising , this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites . It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you . If you would like more information about OBA and how to opt out of it , please visit youronlinechoices.com or networkadvertising.org ( if accessing from the US. )  Please visit audiencescience.com/privacy.asp , quantcast.com/privacy and flurry.com/privacy-policy.html for the privacy policy of our online behavioural targeting technology providers .

Other Advertising Our sites contain links to other websites from which we may earn revenue . Our articles are never influenced by advertisers or affiliates , nor are they written for the purpose of promoting a product , except when clearly branded as a ' sponsored feature ' , ' advertisement feature ' or ' sponsor 's content ' . Legal information and how to contact us Under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 we have to say who the ' data controller ' is for theguardian.com and services provided through our websites .

Placing cookies on your computer means Reuters may serve you advertisements possibly more interesting to you , and allows us to control the number of times you see advertisements and measure effectiveness of ad campaigns . Further information is available below in the Online Behavioural Advertising section , including how you can opt out of online behavioural advertising . You can turn cookies off , but if you do this , you may not be able to use some services on the Reuters site , and you might see more pop-ups and other intrusive advertising , as we wo n't be able to limit what you see using cookies . You will however still be able to view editorial content . For more information on managing your cookies , including how to turn them off , please review the Updating Your Personal Information section above . By permitting cookies to be used you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described above . Online Behavioural Advertising ( OBA ) allows us to deliver targeted advertising to visitors to the Reuters sites . OBA works by showing you advertisements which are based on the type of content you have been reading , and delivering advertisements which we believe may be of interest to you . As you browse Reuters , one of the cookies placed on your computer will be an advertising cookie so we can better understand what sort of pages you are interested in . The information collected about your computer enables us to group you with other computers who have shown similar interests . We can then display advertising to you which is based on these interests . For instance if you have been reading a lot of Food and Drink articles we may decide to show you more advertisements based on food and drink . It 's important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we employ requires us to collect or use personally identifiable information like your name , email address , postal address or telephone number . Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA which enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your online reading away from the Reuters site . For example , if you have visited the website of an online clothing shop you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing . This allows companies to advertise to visitors who are interested in their content after they leave their website . Reuters may also want to share behavioural data with other websites . This may mean that when you are on other websites you are served advertising based on your behaviour on Reuters , and on Reuters you may be served advertising based on your behaviour on other sites . If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using this website . It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised or relevant to you . If you would like to manage your advertising profile , interests and learn how to opt out of online behavioural advertising , please review the Updating Your Personal Information section above .

This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you , what we do with it , with whom we share it , and how you can correct or change such information . It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully , especially before providing any personal data through the Site . This Site is operated in and controlled from the United States of America . If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Site , or if you wish to unsubscribe from Site services for which you have previously registered , please contact us at customercare @ support.cnbc.com or at the address at the end of this policy . PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE SITE CAREFULLY . YOUR USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO SUCH PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE . Personal Data : Personally Identifiable Information ( Personal Data ) is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual , such as your name , email address , home address , phone number and credit card information . This Site collects Personal Data when you interact with the Site , for example when you register for our Subscription Services , including without limitation , CNBC Plus ; subscribe for newsletters ; register for membership services such as chat rooms or message boards ; participate in chat rooms , blogs or other user forums ; respond to polls or surveys ; purchase merchandise via the Site ; register for sweepstakes , contests and other promotional opportunities ; or seek help from our customer service departments . We also may collect information when you purchase products or services offline , or register for wireless services via your cellphone or other wireless devices ( Other Services ) . Because providing detailed information regarding our privacy policy when you register or provide information in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical , you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us . We may also obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties , such as credit agencies . Aggregate and Anonymous Data : Aggregate and anonymous data are information collected automatically through the operation of the Site ( " AA Data " ) . We may collect site usage data ( such as which Site pages you visit and in what sequence ) through the use of various technologies . For example , we collect IP addresses from individuals who visit the Site . An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 're surfing the Web . Web servers , the computers that " serve up " Web pages , automatically identify your computer by its IP address , and when you request a page from a website , its servers log your IP address . We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Data , so although your session will be logged , you will remain anonymous to us and the Site . We may also collect password information from you when you log in , as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version . During some visits , we may use software tools , such as Javascript , to measure and collect session information , including page response times , download errors , time spent on certain pages , page interaction information , and methods used to browse away from the page . Like many sites , we use " cookies " or other similar technologies to collect AA Data . A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit the Site . Cookies allow the Site to measure traffic activity on the Site and to improve your user experience , for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences , allowing you to visit member only portions of the Site without re-registering , and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry , such as sweepstakes . Similarly , if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products and promotions , using cookies we collect information about which Site pages you have visited and in what order ( Clickstream Data ) that may allow us to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences . Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies . If you prefer , you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent , but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so . In addition , we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called pixel tags , web beacons , clear GIFs or similar means ( collectively , Pixel Tags ) embedded in the Site 's content . A Pixel Tag is an electronic image , often a single pixel ( 1x1 ) , that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors ' hard drives . This information is anonymous data . Personal Data : We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided . For example , if you provide Personal Data to register for a newsletter or a text messaging service , to enter a contest or a sweepstake , or to purchase goods or services , we will use it to register you for or provide you with those goods or services . We may also use your Personal Data to provide you with information about features , services and other offerings that may be of interest to you .

Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the Site and AA Data to Personal Data obtained from you . If any AA Data are linked with Personal Data , the linked AA Data will then be treated as Personal Data . AA Data : We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis . In order to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Other Services , CNBC often conducts research on its customer demographics , interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather . Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data , it does not identify you personally . CNBC may share this type of AA Data with a variety of third parties , including its affiliates , agents , and current and prospective business partners . We may use AA Data collected from the Site for site administration , advertising and promotional purposes , and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes . For example , IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide AA Data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Site , and Clickstream Data and demographic AA Data may be shared with our advertisers and business partners . We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows the Site to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site . This data ( including Clickstream Data about your activities on our Site ) may be shared with these companies for this purpose .

When we disclose information to these service providers , we disclose information to help them to perform their service . For example , in order to deliver products to you , we must share some information . We partner with third parties ( such as the U.S. Postal Service , United Parcel Service , and Federal Express ) to ship products , to ensure delivery , and so that we can obtain feedback , improve the quality of our service , and measure and improve the quality of the service of the third party .

For example , we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use the Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud . ( v ) We will not sell ( or trade or rent ) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business . However , it 's possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets . If that happens , your personal information may be disclosed to another company , but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect . ( vi ) We may share non-personal information ( such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page , or the size of an order placed on a certain date ) with third parties such as advertising partners . This information does not directly personally identify you or any user . ( vii ) We may publicly disclose the name , city , and state of the contest and sweepstakes winners .

For example , when you visit the Site , you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment , behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall . While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information , we can not guarantee complete security . 100 % complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline .

As you might expect from us , the majority of information that we collect is obtained through the Site , and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information . We also may collect information offline , where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information . One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions . When someone calls , we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question . When we need to store information ( such as order information ) , we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption . ( See the Data Security section above for more information ) . Another example involves faxes . If you fax something to us , we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information . There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline ( for example , we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information ) , and this Policy does n't discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses . As we mentioned , we will try to treat offline collection , uses , and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices . If we change or update this Privacy Policy , we will post changes and updates on the Site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect , use and disclose . We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time so you will know if the Privacy Policy has been changed or updated .

If you fax something to us , we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information . There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline ( for example , we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information ) , and this Policy does n't discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses . As we mentioned , we will try to treat offline collection , uses , and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices . If we change or update this Privacy Policy , we will post changes and updates on the Site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect , use and disclose .

A cookie is a small data file that 's stored by your Web browser on your computer .

The BBC is the largest broadcasting organisation in the world . We are a public service broadcaster , established by a Royal Charter and primarily funded by the licence fee that is paid by UK households . The BBC includes the BBC World Service , which broadcasts to the world on radio , on TV and online , providing news and information in 32 languages . It is funded by a government grant , not from the licence fee . The BBC also has a commercial arm , BBC Worldwide Limited and its group companies ( BBC Worldwide ) . BBC Worldwide is a wholly owned subsidiary and returns its profits to the BBC for investment in new programming and services . Amongst other activities , BBC Worldwide operates the international , advertising-funded version of the BBC website , bbc.com , for users from outside of the UK .

By submitting your details , you enable the BBC ( and where applicable its contractors ) to provide you with the services , activities or online content you select . Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information , and sometimes sensitive personal information ( e.g. if you 're sending in an application to be a contributor on a political party we may need to know your political leanings ) . When we do this we will provide further information as to why we are collecting your information and how we will use it . The BBC also uses cookies ( see section 13 below for details ) and collects IP addresses ( an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet ) from visitors to BBC websites . The BBC will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following : to provide our services , activities or online content and to deal with your requests and enquiries ; for " service administration purposes " , which means that the BBC may contact you for reasons related to the service , activity or online content you have signed up for , as set out in section 5 below ( e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service , activity or online content has been suspended for maintenance ) ; to contact you about a submission you have made , including any content you provide . For additional information , please see the UGC FAQS ( User Generated Content Frequently Asked Questions ) ; to provide you with information about our services , activities or online content ; to personalise the way BBC content is presented to you ( e.g. if the first thing you look at every day on the BBC website is the weather for Luton , we may present this information or a link to it on your homepage ) ; to use IP addresses to identify the location of users , to block disruptive use , to establish the number of visits from different countries and to determine whether you are accessing the services from the UK or not . If not , you will be re-directed to the international version of the BBC website ( bbc.com ) , ( see section 12 for details ) ; to analyse and improve the services offered on BBC websites ; to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience . The BBC may also use and disclose information in aggregate ( so that no individuals are identified ) for marketing and strategic development purposes ; and when you access the BBC website from outside the UK , you will see the international version ( bbc.com ) which features advertising . A certain amount of this advertising is tailored to the individual user . BBC Worldwide uses cookies to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the pages you look at on the international version of the BBC website and other BBC Worldwide sites , and your IP address information . This is a practice widely used by other major web publishers and is known as onsite behavioural targeting . The tracking system is anonymised and therefore it does not know who you are : it simply uses the limited information available to it to serve ads to you , if you are accessing the BBC website from outside the UK , which it believes are relevant . Find out more about BBC Worldwide 's use of its behavioural targeting system in the international users section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website . It is important to remember that you will only see this advertising , and receive Behavioural Targeted Marketing cookies , if you are visiting bbc.com from outside the UK .

We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law ( for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies ) or as described in section 8 below . Generally , we will only use your information within the BBC . However , sometimes the BBC uses third parties to process your information on our behalf . The BBC requires these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and the BBC requires that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes , unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way . If you post or send offensive , inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to BBC websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any BBC service , the BBC may use your personal information to stop such behaviour . Where the BBC reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws ( e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory ) , the BBC may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer , school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour . If you are aged 16 or under , please get your parent/guardian 's permission before you provide any personal information to the BBC . Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information . We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity , or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with the BBC or the BBC 's corporate retention schedule ( a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how long ) . If you cancel your registration as a BBC website member and your account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and , while the BBC can not use the personal information , it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically . Where you contribute material to the BBC we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose ( s ) for which it was submitted . For example , we will only keep copies of entries to a photographic competition for the duration of the competition . However other projects ( e.g. the People 's War website ) are likely to have a longer , or even permanent , duration . The BBC , as a publicly funded organisation , also has an obligation to record snapshots of history which may include some User Generated Content i.e. content provided by the public . Therefore , some content submitted to , or shared with , the BBC may be retained for prolonged periods of time or potentially indefinitely in the BBC 's Archive , which is true of News contributions which are published . There may also be rare instances where we will share your contribution with third parties in the interests of maintaining historical archives ( e.g. contributions about people 's experiences in the Second World War were given to the Imperial War Museum ) . Where possible , we will endeavour to inform you upfront or let you know at a later date where we are likely to keep content indefinitely or pass it onto an approved historical archive . Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information the BBC holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected . ( We charge 10 for information requests and require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification ) . We will use reasonable efforts to supply , correct or delete personal information about you on our files .

In late 2005 we launched a new advertising service called online behavioural advertising ( OBA ) . OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to people who visit our website . It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site . It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you . As you browse our sites , some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies , so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in We can then display advertising on your browser that is based on these perceived interests . For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles , you may be shown more adverts for food and drink . It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we use will collect information such as your name , email address , postal address or phone number . We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners . This may mean that when you are on other websites , you will be shown advertising based on your behaviour on theguardian.com . We may also show you advertising on our site based on your behaviour on other sites . Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites . For example , if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop , you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing . This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase . The privacy policy of criteo , one of the partners that we work with for behavioural retargeting is shown here . criteo.com/en/privacy-policy . If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising , this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites .
