Testing on a test set of only 18 speeches may not accurately reflect the estimation and the effectiveness of our classifier.

In order to make a better evaluation:
1. We can add more test cases
2. Split each speech into small segments and test on each segment

Drawbacks:
1. It might be hard to find a lot of test cases with proper labels
2. For each segment, the lack of appearances of vocabularies in the training set may also influence our evaluation.
