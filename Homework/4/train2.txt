RED	THANKS ... IT IS AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS AWARD AND TO BE ASSOCIATED IN A SMALL WAY WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO FOUGHT TIRELESSLY TO LIFT THE NATION . I'M SURE HE WOULD BE CHEERING THE LIFE AFFIRMING DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT . THE GREAT ISSUES OF OUR TIMES - THE LIFE AND DEATH ISSUES - SHOULD BE , AS THIS COURT REALIZES , IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS . BUT OUR HEARTS ARE MORE HEAVY THAN UNKNOWNWORD TONIGHT . THEY ARE HEAVY WITH THE AWFUL WEIGHT THAT RESTS ON THEM . THE WEIGHT OF LOST LIVES , LOST SENSELESSLY , UNKNOWNWORD , INEXPLICABLY . AS OUR PACE SLOWS , WE CAN LOOK BEYOND THE TUMULT OF DAILY LIVING INTO THE WELLS OF UNKNOWNWORD MEANING , AND PERHAPS WE CAN LEARN ONE OF LIFE'S SOLEMN SERMONS . UNKNOWNWORD AND I SPENT MONDAY AT OUR HOME ON A LAKE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . IT WAS A GREY DAY WITH RECORD RAINFALL . THE LAKE UNKNOWNWORD HAD STILL NOT ENTIRELY MELTED - BUT IT WAS GIVING WAY TO THE WAVES AND THE RAIN . INSIDE , WAS TOASTY WARM . OUR ENTIRE FAMILY HAD UNKNOWNWORD - ALL 22 OF US . UNKNOWNWORD MITT IS UNKNOWNWORD ; OWEN JUST SCOOTS . ELEVEN YEAR OLD ALLIE READS BETTER THAN A FEW OF THE ADULTS . THIS NEW UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION HAS BEEN PLANTED IN GOOD HOMES . A CALL FROM THE OFFICE TOLD ME ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN VIRGINIA . I WENT OUTSIDE TO LET THE NEWS UNKNOWNWORD . I COULD SEE MY FAMILY THROUGH THE WINDOWS . I TRIED TO IMAGINE THE SORROW I WOULD FEEL IN LOSING ONE OF THEM . BUT I COULDN'T DO IT . IT WAS SIMPLY BEYOND MY IMAGINATION . THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN LIFE , IT SEEMS , THAT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD IF IT IS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED . MY HEART MOURNS FOR THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I CANNOT FULLY COMPREHEND THE DEPTH OF THEIR LOSS . I PRAY FOR THEM . WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF WHAT HAPPENED AT VIRGINIA TECH ? YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY DRAWN YOUR OWN LESSONS . OTHERS WILL BE ADDED OVER DAYS AND WEEKS BY BOTH THE THOUGHTFUL AND THE UNKNOWNWORD . I HOPE THAT YOU WILL FIND WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER TONIGHT TO BE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY . I PICKED UP MY BIBLE YESTERDAY TO RE-READ THE ACCOUNT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF ABEL BY HIS BROTHER . IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE AFTER THE FALL OF ADAM AND EVE FROM THE GARDEN , WHERE THEY WERE TOLD BY GOD THAT HE WOULD PLACE WHAT HE CALLED ENMITY ON THE EARTH . THERE IS A LESSON BEING TAUGHT : EVIL AND GOOD HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE BEGINNING . CAIN MURDERED HIS YOUNGER BROTHER ABEL BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS OF HIM , ANGRY THAT HE WAS MORE FAVORED . EVIL IS NOT GOING TO SIMPLY GO AWAY . WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT HAS EVIL AS WELL AS GOOD . PERHAPS THAT UNKNOWNWORD OBVIOUS . I THINK IT IS . BUT WHEN HITLER WROTE OF HIS GENOCIDAL PLANS , EDUCATED PEOPLE SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SUCH EVIL WAS POSSIBLE . THE SAME IS TRUE OF AHMADINEJAD TODAY - HIS EVIL IS UNKNOWNWORD BY THOSE WHO CANNOT BRING THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THAT EVIL LIKE THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS IN THE HEART OF MAN . FOLLOWING THE END OF THE COLD WAR , PRESIDENT CLINTON BEGAN TO DISMANTLE OUR MILITARY . HE UNKNOWNWORD OUR FORCES BY 500,000 . HE UNKNOWNWORD ALMOST 80 SHIPS . OUR SPENDING ON NATIONAL DEFENSE DROPPED FROM OVER 6 % OF GDP TO 3.8 % TODAY . HE CALLED IT A PEACE DIVIDEND . WE GOT THE DIVIDEND , BUT WE DIDN'T GET THE PEACE . CHARLES UNKNOWNWORD CALLED OUR BLISSFUL DISARMAMENT A HOLIDAY FROM HISTORY . FOR HISTORY HAS PLAINLY TAUGHT THAT EVIL IS ON EARTH AND THAT THERE ARE EVIL PEOPLE WHO WILL THREATEN THE GOOD , THE PEACEFUL AND THE FREE . THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT IF THE OPPOSITION PARTY HAD FULL REIGN IN WASHINGTON , WE WOULD NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD TO CONSEQUENCE FROM IRAQ , WE WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING TO FINANCE SOCIAL PROGRAMS . SOME WOULD CELEBRATE , CHANTING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE PEACE A CHANCE . BUT PEACE HAS HAD MANY CHANCES AND IT WILL HAVE MANY MORE . HISTORY TEACHES US THIS : THE BEST ALLY OF PEACE IS A STRONG AMERICA . AS RONALD REAGAN SAID : OF THE FOUR WARS IN MY LIFETIME , NONE CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE U.S . WAS TOO STRONG . AND IT WAS ALSO PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO LABELED THE SOVIET UNION AN EVIL EMPIRE - MUCH TO THE HORROR OF FOREIGN POLICY ELITES . YET HE WAS RIGHT . TWENTY YEARS LATER , PRESIDENT BUSH WAS CRITICIZED FOR UNKNOWNWORD CERTAIN COUNTRIES PART OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVIL . AGAIN , FOREIGN POLICY ELITES UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WHAT THESE ELITES FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT RADICAL ISLAM HAS AS ITS INTENTION THE OVERTHROW OF ALL MODERATE ISLAMIC GOVERNMENTS ... UNKNOWNWORD ... COLLAPSE OF THE WEST AND THE US . TODAY , IRAN IS WORKING TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR BOMB ... IRAN , WHOSE PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD THE HISTORY OF HOLOCAUST AND CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATION FOUNDED BY ITS EMACIATED YET HOPEFUL SURVIVORS . EVIL INDEED EXISTS IN THE WORLD . THE RIGHT COURSE FOR AMERICA IN A WORLD WHERE EVIL STILL EXISTS IS NOT ACQUIESCENCE AND WEAKNESS , IT IS ASSERTIVENESS AND STRENGTH . I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US ADD AT LEAST 100,000 TROOPS TO OUR MILITARY , INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING TO AT LEAST 4 % OF OUR GDP , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR NON-MILITARY RESOURCES TO SUPPORT MODERATE , MODERN MUSLIM PEOPLE AND NATIONS . SOME OF OUR CITIZENS SEE THE EVIL IN THE WORLD , BUT ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD SIMPLY ISOLATE OURSELVES FROM IT . BUT ONE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVIL IS THAT IT SEEKS DOMINATION OVER OTHERS , ALL OTHERS . HITLER WAS POISED TO CONQUER ONE LAST UNKNOWNWORD ISLAND AND JAPAN HAD ATTACKED OUR PACIFIC FLEET - THERE IS NO SAFE PLACE IF EVIL IS UNRESTRAINED . THE WEAK MAY HIDE , BUT THEY BECOME WEAKER STILL , UNTIL AT LAST THEY ARE DISCOVERED , AND EASILY CONQUERED . IT IS UP TO US TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG . AND WHILE WE WILL ALWAYS DEFEND AMERICA ON OUR OWN IF EVER CALLED , WE KNOW OUR STRENGTH IS UNKNOWNWORD WHEN IT IS COMBINED WITH THE STRENGTH OF OTHER NATIONS . WHETHER UNKNOWNWORD , ECONOMIC , OR MILITARY , AMERICA IS STRONGER WHEN WE HAVE FRIENDS STANDING WITH US . I AGREE WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER AZNAR OF SPAIN THAT WE SHOULD BUILD ON THE NATO ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAM . AND FURTHER , IF I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WOULD CALL FOR A UNKNOWNWORD OF NATIONS TO CREATE A NEW PARTNERSHIP - A PARTNERSHIP FOR HOPE AND PROSPERITY . THIS PARTNERSHIP WOULD ASSEMBLE THE RESOURCES OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO WORK TO ASSURE THAT ISLAMIC STATES THAT ARE THREATENED WITH VIOLENT JIHAD HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , NOT WAHHABI MADRASES , UNKNOWNWORD CREDIT AND BANKING , THE RULE OF LAW , HUMAN RIGHTS , BASIC HEALTHCARE , AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES . THE RESOURCES WOULD BE DRAWN FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS , AND FROM VOLUNTEERS AND NGOS . TOGETHER , WE WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD THE GROUNDWORK OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY . MERELY CLOSING OUR EYES AND HOPING THAT RADICAL JIHAD WILL GO AWAY IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER . AND AMERICAN MILITARY ACTION ALONE CANNOT CHANGE THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS . ONLY MUSLIMS WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEAT RADICAL JIHAD . BUT WE CAN HELP THEM . AND WE MUST HELP THEM . FOR THE CONSEQUENCES FOR AMERICA AND FOR ALL NATIONS OF A UNKNOWNWORD ISLAMIC WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR WEAPONS , ARE UNTHINKABLE . IT IS ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE OF EVIL TO CALL ITSELF GOOD AND TO UNKNOWNWORD THE GOOD AS EVIL . IT IS STUPEFYING TO MOST AMERICANS THAT BIN LADEN AND AHMADINEJAD AND CHAVEZ CALL US , AMERICA , EVIL . BUT UNKNOWNWORD AGO , UNKNOWNWORD , A PROPHET OF THE OLD TESTAMENT , SAID THIS : UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD , AND GOOD EVIL ; THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT , AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS ; THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER ! AND SO , WE SHOULD NOT BE TERRIBLY UNKNOWNWORD WHEN WE ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD SCORNED BY THESE PURVEYORS OF HATE . BUT WE ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT FAULT . WE CAN . AND SHOULD . DO A BETTER JOB TO PROMOTE FREEDOM . WHEN LEBANON'S NEW LEADERSHIP WAS FACING THE TEST OF DEMOCRACY , WE WATCHED AS HEZBOLLAH BROUGHT THE LEBANESE PEOPLE SCHOOLS AND HEALTHCARE . OUR RESOURCES COULD HAVE HELPED BUT THEY ARE ALL HOUSED IN SEPARATE BUREAUCRACIES , UNKNOWNWORD ON PROTECTING THEIR OWN POWERS AND BUDGETS AND UNKNOWNWORD . SO GUESS WHO THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED WHEN UNKNOWNWORD BROKE OUT ? AND SO TOO FOR HAMAS AMONG THE PALESTINIANS . THE PROBLEM WAS JUST AS EVIDENT IN IRAQ . WHILE THE MILITARY MOVED IN RAPID ORDER TO TOPPLE SADDAM HUSSEIN , OUR NON-MILITARY RESOURCES MOVED LIKE THEY WERE STUCK IN TAR . THEY FIGHT OVER WHICH UNKNOWNWORD WILL PAY THE $11.00 PER DIEM COST OF UNKNOWNWORD AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE SPENDING $7 BILLION A MONTH AND TAKING HUMAN CASUALTIES . IT IS HIGH TIME TO TRANSFORM OUR CIVILIAN INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER . JUST AS THE MILITARY HAS DIVIDED THE WORLD INTO COMMON REGIONS WITH A SINGLE COMMANDER , OUR CIVILIAN AGENCIES MUST NOW FOLLOW SUIT . WITH A SINGLE CIVILIAN LEADER , WHO LIKE THEIR MILITARY COUNTERPART IS FULLY EMPOWERED WITH AUTHORITY , RESPONSIBILITY AND RESOURCES , WE CAN SPREAD OUR GREAT INSTRUMENTS OF PEACE , LIKE HEALTH CARE AND THE RULE OF LAW TO NATIONS EVERYWHERE . IT IS TIME THAT WE APPLY THESE AMERICAN WONDERS TO MAKE THE WORLD , AND IN TURN TO MAKE AMERICA , A SAFER , FREER , AND MORE PROSPEROUS PLACE . AND SO , WE CAN PROJECT AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND ITS GOODNESS TO THE WORLD . BUT WE CANNOT PROJECT MORE STRENGTH AND MORE GOODNESS THAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE . WHAT IS THEIR SOURCE ? MY LIBERAL FRIENDS WOULD SAY THAT AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE OF OUR GREAT GOVERNMENT . IT IS A GREAT GOVERNMENT . BUT THAT IS NOT THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH . THE SOURCE OF AMERICA'S STRENGTH IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE - HARD WORKING , EDUCATED , RISK TAKING , GOD-LOVING , FAMILY-ORIENTED , SACRIFICING , PATRIOTIC , UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN PEOPLE . THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE ! I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I HAVE FAITH IN OUR CHILDREN , AND IN OUR GRANDCHILDREN . BUT AT THE SAME TIME , I AM DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEM TODAY . FOLLOWING THE COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS , PEGGY NOONAN WROTE AN UNKNOWNWORD DESCRIBING WHAT SHE CALLED THE OCEAN IN WHICH OUR CHILDREN SWIM . IT WAS A CESSPOOL OF VIOLENCE , SEX , DRUGS , UNKNOWNWORD , PERVERSION . SHE SAID THAT THE BOYS WHO DID THE SHOOTING HAD UNKNOWNWORD TOO DEEP THE OCEAN IN WHICH THEY SWAM . I'D LIKE TO CLEAN UP THE WATER IN WHICH OUR KIDS ARE SWIMMING . I'D LIKE TO KEEP PORNOGRAPHY FROM COMING UP ON UNKNOWNWORD COMPUTERS . I'D LIKE TO KEEP DRUGS OFF THE STREETS . I'D LIKE TO SEE LESS VIOLENCE AND SEX ON TV AND IN MOVIES AND IN UNKNOWNWORD GAMES . IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS , WE CAN DO A GREAT DEAL MORE TO CLEAN THE SWIMMING WATER . BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO DO AS WELL . I REMEMBER SWIMMING ONE AFTERNOON IN LAKE HURON , ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD . MY FRIEND TOMMY MCCAFFREY AND I WERE UNKNOWNWORD OR 12 AS I RECALL . THE LAKE WAS UNKNOWNWORD , WITH 4 FOOT WAVES BREAKING AT THE SECOND SANDBAR . WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO STAY IN CLOSE , BUT WE WANDERED OUT TOO DEEP , AND FOUND OURSELVES BEING DRAWN BEYOND OUR RESISTANCE . THEN SUDDENLY MRS . MCCAFFREY WAS THERE , GRABBING US BOTH BY THE ARM . SHE HAD HER DRESS ON . AND HER FACE , IT WAS SERIOUS . AND IT WAS SET LIKE A FLINT TOWARD SHORE . I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID . BUT I REMEMBER WHAT I FELT : THANKFUL ! I'D LIKE THERE TO BE A LOT MORE MRS . MCCAFFREY'S . I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK BEING DONE TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S FUTURE IS THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE WITHIN THE 4 UNKNOWNWORD OF THE AMERICAN HOME . AS A CHILD SWIMS THROUGH OUR INCREASINGLY POLLUTED AND UNKNOWNWORD WATERS , THERE IS NO HELP THAT IS MORE SURE THAN A LOVING MOTHER AND FATHER . IT IS TIME THAT WE SAY WHAT WE KNOW : EVERY CHILD DESERVES A MOTHER AND A FATHER . I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE . THE NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES IS DAUNTING . FREEDOM CONFRONTS ENEMIES ON FAR-FLUNG BATTLEFIELDS , AND ITS CHILDREN OF PROMISE MUST NAVIGATE THE TROUBLED WATERS AT HOME . ABIGAIL ADAMS WROTE TO HER SON WHEN HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY GREAT NECESSITIES , SHE SAID , BRING FORTH GREAT VIRTUES . AND SO IT IS . I SEE THEM IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY . I HAVE SEEN THEM THROUGHOUT MY LIFE . ON MONDAY WE SAW GOOD AND EVIL IN STARK CONTRAST AT A CAMPUS IN VIRGINIA . AND WHILE WE'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE EVIL , WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THE GOOD . LIVIU LIBRESCU , AN ENGINEERING PROFESSOR AT VIRGINIA TECH , WAS A HOLOCAUST UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT HE HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED THE WORST EVIL IMAGINABLE . YET ON MONDAY HE UNKNOWNWORD WHILE BARRING THE CLASSROOM DOOR WITH HIS BODY SO HIS STUDENTS COULD FLEE OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO ESCAPE A BRUTAL KILLER . AS A POSTING ON A WEBSITE SAID , THOUGH NOT IN HEIGHT , HE WAS IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS A MAN OF STATURE . AMERICA IS A NATION OF STATURE , THANKS TO MEN LIKE PROFESSOR LIBRESCU , THANKS TO BRAVE AND PATRIOTIC SOLDIERS AROUND THE WORLD , THANKS TO GREAT AND NOBLE MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY . IT IS WHY WE KNOW THAT AMERICA WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION OF TODAY'S CHALLENGES . IT IS WHY WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT , IN THE WORDS OF ONE GREAT AMERICAN THIS NATION , WILL ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD A SHINING CITY ON A HILL . 
RED	THANK YOU , MY FRIENDS , AND THANK YOU , SOUTH CAROLINA , FOR BRINGING US ACROSS THE FINISH LINE FIRST IN THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH PRIMARY . IT TOOK US A WHILE , BUT WHAT'S EIGHT YEARS AMONG FRIENDS . IT JUST GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MORE TIME IN THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE ; TO TALK WITH YOU AND LISTEN TO YOU ; AND TO COME TO UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE MORE THE DEEP PATRIOTISM OF SOUTH CAROLINIANS , WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM ITS ENEMIES . IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO HAVE COME TO KNOW SO MANY OF YOU , AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR AND HUMBLED BY THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN OUR CAMPAIGN . THANK YOU ESPECIALLY , FOR BRAVING THE VERY UN-SOUTH CAROLINA LIKE WEATHER TODAY TO EXERCISE THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OF AN AMERICAN ; NOT JUST THOSE SOUTH CAROLINIANS WHO VOTED FOR US , BUT ALL OF YOU WHO VOTED TODAY FOR THE CANDIDATE YOU BELIEVE IS BEST SUITED TO LEAD THE COUNTRY YOU LOVE . I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN UNKNOWNWORD ES , WHEN I SAY , SOUTH CAROLINIANS ARE NEVER JUST FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS . AND , OF COURSE , I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO OUR SOUTH CAROLINA TEAM , AND TO THE MANY DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE SO GENEROUSLY OF THEIR TIME AND LABOR AND KEPT US COMPETITIVE IN SOME PRETTY CHALLENGING TIMES . I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS TO ME . THE DEBT I OWE YOU IS A PRIVILEGE AND AN OBLIGATION , WHICH I PROMISE YOU , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD DISCHARGE . I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE , CINDY , THE BEST CAMPAIGNER IN THE FAMILY , AND MY DAUGHTERS MEGHAN AND UNKNOWNWORD , WHO ARE WITH US TONIGHT , AS WELL AS MY SON , UNKNOWNWORD , AND OUR CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT BE HERE , AND OF COURSE , MY DEAR MOTHER , ROBERTA MCCAIN . IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME , AND TO ALL WHO KNOW ME , THAT WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT , BUT FOR YOUR LOVE , ENCOURAGEMENT AND FAITH IN ME . IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , I HAVE TRIED AS BEST I COULD , TO TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR COUNTRY , AND HOW I INTEND TO ADDRESS THEM . AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE , I KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I MUST EARN YOUR RESPECT . AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IS BY BEING HONEST WITH YOU . I HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN , AND TO PUT MY TRUST IN YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE ME YOUR FAIR CONSIDERATION . SO FAR , IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT JUST FINE . I AM AWARE THAT FOR THE LAST 28 YEARS , THE WINNER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY HAS BEEN THE NOMINEE OF OUR PARTY . WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO , OF COURSE . THERE ARE SOME TOUGH CONTESTS AHEAD , STARTING TOMORROW IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA . BUT , MY FRIENDS , WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TONIGHT . AND I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT OUR CHANCES . AS PLEASED AS WE ARE THAT WE HAVE A REASON TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT , I KNOW THAT I MUST KEEP FOREMOST IN MY MIND THAT I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BE SOMEBODY , BUT TO DO SOMETHING . I AM RUNNING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND PROUD . I AM RUNNING TO RESTORE THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I AM RUNNING SO THAT OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE EVEN GREATER OPPORTUNITIES THAN THE ONES WE WERE BLESSED WITH . I AM RUNNING SO THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY , NOW AND IN GENERATIONS TO COME , WILL KNOW THE SAME , UNKNOWNWORD HONOR THAT HAS BEEN THE TREASURE OF MY LIFE : TO BE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN . I SEEK THE NOMINATION OF OUR PARTY , BECAUSE I AM AS CONFIDENT TODAY AS I WAS WHEN I FIRST ENTERED PUBLIC LIFE AS A FOOT SOLDIER IN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE GOOD SENSE AND RESOURCEFULNESS OF FREE PEOPLE -- ARE ALWAYS IN AMERICA'S BEST INTERESTS . IN WAR AND PEACE , IN GOOD TIMES AND CHALLENGING ONES , WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IT TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE FROM ITS ENEMIES , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FREE OF A HEAVY HANDED GOVERNMENT THAT SPENDS TOO MUCH OF THEIR MONEY , AND TRIES TO DO FOR THEM WHAT THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO DO FOR THEMSELVES . WE WANT GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB ; TO DO IT BETTER AND TO DO IT WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY ; TO DEFEND OUR NATION'S SECURITY WISELY AND EFFECTIVELY , BECAUSE THE COST OF OUR DEFENSE IS SO DEAR TO US ; TO RESPECT OUR VALUES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH ; TO ENFORCE T HE RULE OF LAW THAT IS FIRST DEFENSE OF FREEDOM ; TO KEEP THE PROMISES IT MAKES TO US AND NOT MAKE PROMISES IT WILL NOT KEEP . WE BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO ONLY THOSE THINGS WE CANNOT DO UNKNOWNWORD , AND THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS , UNKNOWNWORD , AND ENTERPRISING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN DO WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE , BUILD AN EVEN GREATER COUNTRY THAN THE ONE THEY INHERITED . MY FRIENDS , I KNOW WE ARE FACING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES , AND WE MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF AMERICANS WHO FEAR THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . BUT NOTHING IS INEVITABLE IN OUR COUNTRY . WE ARE THE CAPTAINS OF OUR FATE . WE CAN OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE AS LONG AS WE KEEP OUR COURAGE , AND STAND BY OUR DEFENSE OF FREE MARKETS , LOW TAXES , AND SMALL GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA THE UNKNOWNWORD LAND OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORLD . I HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY ALL MY ADULT LIFE , AND I AM PREPARED FOR THE HIGH OFFICE I SEEK . I ASKED SOUTH CAROLINIANS TO HELP GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE COUNTRY I LOVE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER . YOU HAVE DONE THAT , AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT . I PROMISE YOU I WILL ALWAYS PUT AMERICA -- HER STRENGTH , HER IDEALS , HER FUTURE -- BEFORE EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION . THANK YOU , SOUTH CAROLINA , FOR YOUR TRUST . I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN , SO HELP ME GOD . GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS YOU AS YOU HAVE BLESSED ME . 
RED	THANK YOU . RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT "FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS . IT IS THE CONTINUING REVOLUTION OF THE MARKETPLACE . IT IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD AND SEEK SOLUTIONS ." WE ARE BLESSED BY FREEDOM , BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING IT IN EVERY REALM IS A MESSAGE THAT POLITICIANS DESPERATELY NEED TO HEAR TODAY . UNFORTUNATELY , WE FIND OURSELVES AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S . ECONOMY IS GROWING MORE SLOWLY THAN ANYONE WOULD LIKE . AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE , CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN ARE EVEN UNKNOWNWORD , WITH THE STATE SUFFERING THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD . TOUGH TIMES CAN BREED FEAR , AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING THOSE FEARS TO PUSH AN AGENDA THAT IS TIRED , DANGEROUS , AND WILL ROB US OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM . ONCE AGAIN , THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE OUR CHOICES FOR US -- NOT RESPECT OUR DREAMS , AND TRUST OUR DECISIONS ON HOW BEST TO SEIZE OUR OPPORTUNITIES . UNEMPLOYMENT IS FIVE PERCENT NATIONWIDE , BUT OVER SEVEN PERCENT IN MICHIGAN . TEN PERCENT OF MICHIGAN'S JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED THIS DECADE AND UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE LEFT THE STATE IN THE PAST YEAR . MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS ARE ROOTED IN FAILED GOVERNMENT POLICIES . HEAVY REGULATION , TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES , AND A HIGH COST OF DOING BUSINESS HAS HURT IT DEARLY . MICHIGAN RANKS 49TH AMONG STATES IN ITS CORPORATE TAX CLIMATE , 45TH IN ITS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TAX CLIMATE AND 25TH IN PROPERTY TAXES . THE WORST THING THAT GOVERNMENT COULD DO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS RAISE TAXES . AND YET THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE . HIGHER TAXES DISCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS , INHIBIT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND SLOW LONG-TERM GROWTH . AT A TIME WHEN IT CAN BE HARD FOR FAMILIES TO WEATHER TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES , THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT MAKE IT HARDER . WE SHOULD CUT TAXES RIGHT NOW ON THE MIDDLE CLASS BY ELIMINATING THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX , WHICH NO LONGER TAXES JUST THE RICH . IT TAXES 25 MILLION MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES , TAKING FROM THEM NEARLY $2,200 PER FAMILY . MY MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SLUGGISH U.S . ECONOMY NEEDS . IT WOULD LOWER MARGINAL TAX RATES , RAISE ECONOMIC GROWTH IMMEDIATELY AND OVER THE LONGER TERM , AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS LEAD TO AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA . IT IS WHAT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WOULD CALL "THE RIGHT STIMULUS ." I WON'T LET THE DEMOCRATS ROLL BACK THE BUSH TAX CUTS . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD PROTECT THE AMERICAN FAMILY AGAINST TAX INCREASES BY REQUIRING A THREE-FIFTHS MAJORITY IN CONGRESS TO RAISE TAXES . BUT I WILL CUT MIDDLE CLASS TAXES AND KEEP THEM LOW THE RIGHT WAY -- BY ALSO CUTTING SPENDING SO WE DON'T ADD TO THE DEBT WE LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN . EVEN IF WE SUCCEED IN KEEPING TAXES LOW , MICHIGAN BUSINESSES -- LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES , SMALL BUSINESS , AND ENTREPRENEURS ALIKE -- FACE A TSUNAMI OF RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS . RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE A THREAT TO OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS , AMERICAN FAMILIES ' BUDGETS , OUR GOVERNMENT'S SOLVENCY , AND THE PROFITABILITY OF AMERICAN BUSINESS . WE MUST UNKNOWNWORD IN THE GROWING COST OF CARE IF WE ARE TO COMPETE GLOBALLY . MY PLAN PUTS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF FAMILIES -- A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO $5,000 FOR A FAMILY AND OPENS UP GREATER COMPETITION AND INNOVATION SO THAT EVERYONE -- HOSPITALS , INSURANCE COMPANIES , DOCTORS , DRUG COMPANIES -- IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN FAMILY . THE WALL STREET JOURNAL CALLED IT UNKNOWNWORD SIDE MEDICINE " FOR AMERICAN HEALTH CARE . IT WILL LOWER COSTS , MAINTAIN QUALITY , AND END THE FRUSTRATION OF AMERICAN FAMILIES . HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUFFERS FROM TOO MUCH REGULATION . RONALD REAGAN UNKNOWNWORD US 25 YEARS AGO THE POWER OF DEREGULATION TO BUILD PROSPERITY . MICHIGAN -- AND THE UNITED STATES -- NEEDS DEREGULATION , FREEDOM , INNOVATION , AND PRIVATE CONTROL OF MONEY -- ESPECIALLY IN HEALTH CARE REFORM . MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS GOT WORSE LAST YEAR WHEN THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEARLY SHUT DOWN , AND DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES NECESSARY TO FOCUS SPENDING ON GENUINE PRIORITIES . IT'S YET ANOTHER REASON WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE TRUST OF TAXPAYERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY WISELY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . WHEN CONGRESS SENDS A PORK-LADEN SPENDING BILL TO MY DESK , I WILL VETO IT . CONGRESS JUST PASSED ANOTHER HUGE , PORK-FILLED SPENDING BILL . THE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED LESS THAN A DAY TO READ ALL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IT WITH NEARLY 10,000 EARMARKS COSTING ABOUT $10 BILLION DOLLARS . I WOULD VETO THAT BILL . WE NEED TO SEND WASHINGTON A MESSAGE : NO EARMARKS . NOT 10,000 . NOT 1 . ZERO . I WILL ENFORCE FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND RETURN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO ITS PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB , AND SHOULD DO IT WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY . WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S HOUSE IS NOT IN ORDER , IT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNCERTAINTY TO THE ECONOMY , RAISING INTEREST RATES , AND ULTIMATELY HARMING CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES . WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LOW , INDIVIDUALS CAN AFFORD HOME UNKNOWNWORD , BUY NEW CARS , PAY OFF THEIR CREDIT CARD DEBTS MORE EASILY , AND MORE JOBS ARE CREATED . TOUGH TIMES BREED FEAR , MY FRIENDS , AND WE ARE HEARING THE FEAR-MONGERS SAY THAT MICHIGAN CANNOT COMPETE ON GLOBAL MARKETS . THOSE VOICES IGNORE THE LESSON OF HISTORY THAT ANY NATION THAT TURNS TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ITSELF IN THE END . WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOWER BARRIERS TO TRADE BECAUSE NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD LIVE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES . WE NEED TO HAVE COMPETITIVE MANUFACTURING THROUGH LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS , LOWER TAXES , AND OPENING NEW MARKETS . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS . I WILL MAKE SURE THAT MICHIGAN CAN COMPETE . ALREADY IT EXPORTS UNKNOWNWORD BILLION TO CANADA , A UNKNOWNWORD TRADING PARTNER . BETWEEN 2001 AND 2006 , MICHIGAN EVEN INCREASED ITS EXPORTS TO CHINA -- YES , CHINA -- BY OVER UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . BUT WE CAN DO BETTER . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THAT CHINA TRADES FAIRLY AND THAT THE WTO AGREEMENTS ARE ENFORCED SO THAT THEIR IMPORTS ARE SAFE . IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO VIEW ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA IN UNKNOWNWORD . I AM CONCERNED THAT CHINA THROUGH ITS PIRACY OF US INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS ALSO BUILDING ITSELF INTO A MILITARY SUPERPOWER THAT HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED THE CAPABILITY TO SHOOT DOWN SATELLITES . WE WILL ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING CHINA TO MEET ITS INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS BY ENGAGING IT ON THE FULL RANGE OF ISSUES INVOLVED IN OUR RELATIONS -- FROM SUPPRESSION OF PERSONAL AND RELIGIOUS UNKNOWNWORD , TO RELATIONS WITH NORTH UNKNOWNWORD AND IRAN , TO ITS RISING INFLUENCE IN AFRICA -- WHICH WILL DETERMINE WHETHER CHINA WILL EMERGE AS A RESPONSIBLE OR IRRESPONSIBLE WORLD POWER . I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN THESE AREAS THAT WILL ALSO SERVE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT AMERICAN WORKERS -- THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKER IN THE WORLD -- WILL BE EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE . GLOBALIZATION IS HERE TO STAY . THAT IS NOT SOMETHING TO FEAR . IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SEIZED . BUT GLOBALIZATION WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD BENEFIT EVERY AMERICAN . CHANGE IS HARD , AND WHILE MOST OF US GAIN , SOME INDUSTRIES , COMPANIES AND WORKERS ARE FORCED TO UNKNOWNWORD WITH VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES . IT WASN'T GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SPEND MILLIONS TO SAVE BUGGY UNKNOWNWORD FACTORIES AND UNKNOWNWORD WHEN CARS REPLACED CARRIAGES AND MEN STOPPED WEARING UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IT IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO HELP WORKERS GET THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED FOR THE NEW JOBS THAT WILL BE CREATED BY NEW BUSINESSES IN THIS NEW CENTURY . RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR DISPLACED WORKERS AND OTHERS OUT OF A JOB . OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST WORKERS THROUGH A FEW TOUGH MONTHS DURING AN ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL THEIR OLD JOBS CAME BACK . WE NEED PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY . IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK WITH CONGRESS AND THE STATES TO UNKNOWNWORD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND MAKE IT A PROGRAM FOR RETRAINING , RELOCATING AND UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST A JOB THAT'S NOT COMING BACK TO FIND A JOB THAT WON'T GO AWAY . WE NEED TO BETTER CONNECT TRAINING WITH BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND NEEDS . AS I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AND EDUCATION EXPERTS I HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD DO A GREAT JOB OF UNKNOWNWORD THE RIGHT SKILLS TO WORKERS AND THE RIGHT WORKERS FOR FIRMS . WE SHOULD TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF THIS RECORD OF SUCCESS . AND WE CAN TRUST WORKERS TO CHOOSE . WE NEED TO TRANSFORM RIGID TRAINING PROGRAMS TO APPROACHES THAT CAN BE USED TO MEET THE BILLS , PAY FOR TRAINING , AND GET BACK TO WORK . OLDER WORKERS CAN USE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND WORK UNKNOWNWORD TO ADAPT TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT JOB , BUT OFTEN THE STARTING PAY OF THE NEXT JOB DOESN'T MEASURE UP . WE SHOULD GIVE THESE DISPLACED WORKERS WHO MOVE TO A NEW JOB A FEW YEARS OF SUPPLEMENT TO THEIR EARNINGS SO THAT THE IMPACT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DISLOCATION IS NOT SO SEVERE . THEY WILL BE LESS RESISTANT TO TAKING A LOWER PAYING JOB AND WE WILL ALL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEIR EXPERIENCE BACK ON THE JOB . I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN SOMEONE'S VOTE , I HAVE TO WIN THEIR RESPECT . AND TO DO THAT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU . SO HERE'S A LITTLE STRAIGHT TALK I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN WILL UNDERSTAND . SOME JOBS THAT HAVE LEFT MICHIGAN ARE NOT COMING BACK . AND THE ANSWER TO THAT ISN'T TO RAISE FALSE UNKNOWNWORD THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN BRING BACK LOST JOBS BUT TO CREATE NEW ONES . OUR COUNTRY'S DANGEROUS DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL THREATENS BOTH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT , NOT TO MENTION THE TERRIBLY INJURIOUS EFFECT HIGH OIL UNKNOWNWORD HAS ON OUR ECONOMY . THE TRANSFER OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF AMERICAN WEALTH TO THE MIDDLE EAST HELPS SUSTAIN THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH TERRORISTS PREY . SOME OF THE MOST OIL-RICH NATIONS ARE THE MOST STAGNANT SOCIETIES ON EARTH . AS LONG AS PETRO-DOLLARS FLOW FREELY TO THEM THOSE REGIMES HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO OPEN THEIR POLITICS AND ECONOMIES SO THAT ALL THEIR PEOPLE MAY BENEFIT FROM THEIR COUNTRIES ' NATURAL WEALTH . THE MIDDLE EAST'S EXAMPLE IS SPREADING TO OUR OWN HEMISPHERE . VENEZUELA'S HUGO CHAVEZ IS USING HIS COUNTRY'S OIL REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A DICTATORSHIP , BULLY HIS NEIGHBORS AND SUCCEED CASTRO AS LATIN AMERICA'S LEADING ANTAGONIST OF THE UNITED STATES . IN RUSSIA , VLADIMIR PUTIN IS USING OIL AS A GEOPOLITICAL WEAPON AND THE SALES PROCEEDS TO FUND A ROLLBACK OF DEMOC RACY . AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE MAKE AMERICA SAFER , WE CAN MEET OUR OBLIGATION TO FUTURE GENERATIONS . I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE NOW JUST AS REPUBLICAN TEDDY ROOSEVELT HAD THE VISION A CENTURY AGO TO PRESERVE MANY OF THE NATURAL TREASURES OUR FAMILIES ENJOY TODAY . AMERICA REMAINS THE WORLD'S INNOVATOR ; WE CAN AND SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS , AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICAN INGENUITY AND ENTREPRENEURIALISM TO KEEP US ON THE CUTTING EDGE . WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT MICHIGAN , AND THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF YOUR PROSPERITY . HASTENING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES , INCLUDING NUCLEAR POWER , IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION . BUT NO MORE SO THAN MANUFACTURING CARS THAT RUN ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN GASOLINE . THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY MAKING REAL PROGRESS TOWARD THIS END , BUT WE MUST ACCELERATE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WILL REDUCE OUR CONSUMPTION OF GASOLINE -- HYBRID CARS AND HYDROGEN ENGINES AND LONG LASTING BATTERIES AND OTHER PROMISING ADVANCES . MICHIGAN HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE ; BUT IT WILL NOT BE REACHED BY ATTEMPTING TO RECR EATE THE PAST . MY FRIENDS , AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL TO COME . YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME THAT OUR PROBLEMS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE . AMERICANS HAVE NEVER MET A CHALLENGE WE COULDN'T OVERCOME WITH HARD WORK , INGENUITY AND DARING . WE CAN BREAK OUR DANGEROUS DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL ; MAKE OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD SAFER ; OUR ENVIRONMENT CLEANER AND CREATE NEW JOBS FOR THE EXPERIENCED , CAPABLE AND PRODUCTIVE WORKERS OF MICHIGAN . LET IT BEGIN NOW . LET IT BEGIN IN MICHIGAN . WE STAND ON THE THRESHOLD OF ANOTHER CENTURY OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNKNOWNWORD ANOTHER CHAPTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS . THOSE OF US PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY NEED ONLY BE UNKNOWNWORD OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE US GREAT , HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND BY OUR PRINCIPLES , HONOR OUR PUBLIC TRUST , AND KEEP OUR PROMISES TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S INTERESTS BEFORE OUR OWN . THANK YOU . 
RED	THANK YOU . I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE AT THE CENTER FOR HYDROGEN RESEARCH AND TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT A GREAT AND URGENT CHALLENGE - BREAKING OUR NATION'S CRITICAL DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF OIL , AND MAKING AMERICA SAFER , STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS BY UNKNOWNWORD THE WAY WE GENERATE AND EMPLOY ENERGY . SOUTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN MAKING AMERICA MORE ENERGY SECURE , PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF NUCLEAR POWER . FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE WAS CRITICAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY . IN THE FUTURE THIS SITE WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR MOVE TOWARD ENERGY SECURITY . OIL IS OFTEN CALLED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY - THE INDISPENSABLE COMMODITY THAT KEEPS COMMERCE UNKNOWNWORD AND AMERICA ON THE MOVE . BUT , IN TODAY'S WORLD , OUR DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL AND THE WAY WE USE HYDROCARBONS IS A MAJOR STRATEGIC VULNERABILITY , A THREAT TO OUR SECURITY , OUR ECONOMY AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR PLANET . GREAT NATIONS DON'T LEAVE THE 'LIFEBLOOD ' OF THEIR ECONOMY IN THE HANDS OF FOREIGN CARTELS OR UNKNOWNWORD THEIR FUTURE ON A COMMODITY LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE AUTHORITARIANS UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PEOPLE AND TERRORISTS FIND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD SUPPORT . TERRORISTS UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR VULNERABILITY . AL QAEDA PLANS FOR ATTACKS ON OIL FACILITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO DESTROY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY . A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO , A SUICIDE ATTACK AT A MAJOR SAUDI UNKNOWNWORD OIL REFINERY CAME CLOSE TO DISABLING ITS TARGET . WE'RE ONE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK AWAY FROM AN ECONOMIC CRISIS . THE FLOW OF OIL HAS MANY UNKNOWNWORD - PIPELINES , REFINERIES , UNKNOWNWORD ROUTES , AND TERMINALS ; MOST OF THEM OUTSIDE OUR JURISDICTION AND CONTROL . OUR ENEMIES UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS ON AMERICA OF A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY - A CRIPPLED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM , GASOLINE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY AMERICANS TO PURCHASE , BUSINESSES UNKNOWNWORD . AL QAEDA MUST REVEL IN THE IRONY THAT AMERICA IS EFFECTIVELY HELPING TO FUND BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR THEY CAUSED . AS WE SACRIFICE BLOOD AND TREASURE , SOME OF OUR GAS DOLLARS FLOW TO THE FANATICS WHO BUILD THE BOMBS , HATCH THE PLOTS , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUT ATTACKS ON OUR SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS . IRAN MADE OVER UNKNOWNWORD BILLION FROM OIL SALES IN 2005 , AND IT IS THE NUMBER ONE STATE UNKNOWNWORD OF TERRORISM . THE TRANSFER OF AMERICAN WEALTH TO THE MIDDLE EAST HELPS SUSTAIN THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH TERRORISTS PREY . SOME OF THE MOST OIL-RICH NATIONS ARE THE MOST STAGNANT SOCIETIES ON EARTH . AS LONG AS PETRO-DOLLARS FLOW FREELY TO THEM THOSE REGIMES HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO OPEN THEIR POLITICS AND ECONOMIES SO THAT ALL THEIR PEOPLE MAY BENEFIT FROM THEIR COUNTRIES ' NATURAL WEALTH . THE MIDDLE EAST'S EXAMPLE IS SPREADING TO OUR OWN HEMISPHERE . VENEZUELA'S HUGO CHAVEZ IS USING HIS COUNTRY'S OIL REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A DICTATORSHIP , BULLY HIS NEIGHBORS AND SUCCEED CASTRO AS LATIN AMERICA'S LEADING ANTAGONIST OF THE UNITED STATES . IN RUSSIA , VLADIMIR PUTIN IS USING OIL AS A GEOPOLITICAL WEAPON AND THE SALES PROCEEDS TO FUND A ROLLBACK OF DEMOCRACY . THE POLITICS OF OIL IMPEDE THE GLOBAL PROGRESS OF OUR VALUES , AND RESTRAINS GOVERNMENTS FROM ACTING ON THE MOST BASIC IMPULSES OF HUMAN DECENCY . THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON CHINA HAS OPPOSED SANCTIONS TO PRESSURE UNKNOWNWORD TO STOP THE KILLING IN DARFUR : CHINA NEEDS SUDAN'S OIL . WE SHOULD HASTEN THE DAY WHEN AMERICA CAN UNKNOWNWORD ITS POWER AT THE TABLE OF DIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THEIR OIL . THE BURNING OF OIL AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS IS UNKNOWNWORD TO THE DANGEROUS ACCUMULATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE , ALTERING OUR CLIMATE WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR SOCIAL , ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UPHEAVAL . IT IS A SERIOUS AND URGENT ECONOMIC , ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE . IS IT TOO BIG A CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA TO TACKLE ? NO , IT IS NOT . NO PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN BETTER INNOVATORS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS THAN AMERICANS . THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO FOLLOW IN DEVELOPING ENERGY SECURITY . IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD TO SEE CHALLENGES AS OPPORTUNITIES ; TO CONQUER PROBLEMS BEYOND THE EXPECTATION OF AN ADMIRING WORLD . AMERICA , RELYING AS ALWAYS ON THE INDUSTRY AND IMAGINATION OF A FREE PEOPLE , AND THE POWER AND INNOVATION OF FREE MARKETS , IS CAPABLE OF OVERCOMING ANY CHALLENGE FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT OUR BORDERS . OUR ENEMIES BELIEVE WE'RE TOO WEAK TO OVERCOME OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL . EVEN SOME OF OUR ALLIES THINK WE'RE NO LONGER THE WORLD'S MOST VISIONARY , MOST CAPABLE COUNTRY OR COMMITTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANKIND . I THINK WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT . I THINK WE KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO . NOW , LET'S REMIND THE WORLD . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL PROPOSE A NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY THAT WILL AMOUNT TO A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FEAR BRED BY OUR RELIANCE ON OIL SHEIKS AND OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE TROUBLED POLITICS OF THE LANDS THEY RULE . WHEN WE REACH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF MILITARY POWER AND DIPLOMACY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE DANGERS OF THAT CAULDRON OF BURNING RESENTMENTS AND EXTREMISM , ENERGY SECURITY IS OUR BEST DEFENSE . WE WON'T ACHIEVE IT TOMORROW , BUT WE MUST ACHIEVE IT IN OUR TIME . THE STRATEGY I PROPOSE WON'T BE ANOTHER GRAB BAG OF HANDOUTS TO THIS OR THAT INDUSTRY AND A FULL UNKNOWNWORD ACT FOR LOBBYISTS . IT WILL RELY ON THE GENIUS AND TECHNOLOGICAL UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE . GOVERNMENT MUST SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS , BUT THE MARKETS SHOULD BE FREE TO PRODUCE THE MEANS . THOSE MEANS ARE WITHIN OUR REACH . ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY USING IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND PRACTICING SENSIBLE HABITS IN OUR HOMES , BUSINESSES AND AUTOMOBILES IS A BIG PART OF THE ANSWER , AND IS SOMETHING WE CAN ACHIEVE RIGHT NOW . FLEXIBLE-FUEL VEHICLES AREN'T UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN EASILY DEPLOY SUCH TECHNOLOGY TODAY FOR LESS THAN $100 PER VEHICLE ; AND WE DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE . ALCOHOL FUELS MADE FROM CORN , UNKNOWNWORD , SWITCH UNKNOWNWORD AND MANY OTHER SOURCES THAT COULD BENEFIT THAT RURAL FARM ECONOMY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND OTHER STATES , FUEL CELLS , BIODIESEL DERIVED FROM WASTE PRODUCTS , NATURAL GAS , AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL PROMISING AND UNKNOWNWORD ALTERNATIVES TO OIL . I WON'T SUPPORT SUBSIDIZING EVERY ALTERNATIVE OR TARIFFS THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE HEALTHY COMPETITION THAT STIMULATES INNOVATION AND LOWER COSTS . BUT I'LL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET GROWTH NECESSARY FOR THESE PRODUCTS TO COMPETE , AND LET CONSUMERS CHOOSE THE WINNERS . I'VE NEVER KNOWN AN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR WORTHY OF THE NAME WHO WOULDN'T RATHER COMPETE FOR SALES THAN SUBSIDIES . AMERICA'S ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION IS FOR THE MOST PART UNKNOWNWORD FREE , AND THE EXISTING ELECTRIC POWER UNKNOWNWORD HAS THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE ADDED DEMAND IMPOSED BY PLUG-IN HYBRID VEHICLES . WE CAN ADD MORE CAPACITY AND IMPROVE ITS RELIABILITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD . I'LL WORK TO PROMOTE REAL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UTILITIES AND AUTOMAKERS TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF PLUG-IN HYBRIDS . WE HAVE IN USE TODAY A ZERO UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY THAT COULD PROVIDE ELECTRICITY FOR MILLIONS MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES THAN IT CURRENTLY DOES . YET IT HAS BEEN OVER UNKNOWNWORD YEARS SINCE A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED . THE BARRIERS TO NUCLEAR ENERGY ARE POLITICAL NOT TECHNOLOGICAL . WE'VE LET THE FEARS OF THIRTY YEARS AGO , AND AN ENDLESS POLITICAL SQUABBLE OVER THE STORAGE OF NUCLEAR SPENT FUEL MAKE IT UNKNOWNWORD IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A SINGLE NEW PLANT THAT PRODUCES A FORM OF ENERGY THAT IS SAFE AND NON-POLLUTING . THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW REACTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT IS MORE FUEL EFFICIENT AND SAFE . IF FRANCE CAN PRODUCE 80 PERCENT OF ITS ELECTRICITY WITH NUCLEAR POWER , WHY CAN'T WE ? IS FRANCE A MORE SECURE , ADVANCED AND INNOVATIVE COUNTRY THAN WE ARE ? ARE FRANCE'S SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS MORE CAPABLE THAN WE ARE ? I NEED NO ANSWER TO THAT UNKNOWNWORD QUESTION . I KNOW MY COUNTRY WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW OTHERWISE . LET'S PROVIDE FOR SAFE STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL , AND GIVE HOST STATES OR LOCALITIES A PROPRIETARY INTEREST SO WHEN ADVANCED RECYCLING TECHNOLOGIES TURN USED FUEL INTO A VALUABLE COMMODITY , THE PUBLIC WILL SHARE IN ITS ECONOMIC BENEFITS . THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE WOULD BE AN IDEAL UNKNOWNWORD TO DEMONSTRATE THAT RECYCLING SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL IS POSSIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES . OTHER COUNTRIES , SUCH AS FRANCE AND JAPAN , ALREADY RECYCLE SPENT FUEL . WE SHOULD DO THE SAME . AND SOUTH CAROLINA'S MOX PROGRAM REMINDS US THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER WILL ENABLE US TO TURN OUR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND MAKE THE WORLD SAFER THROUGH THE CONVERSION OF WEAPONS GRADE MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED BY TERRORISTS OR UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS INTO FUEL FOR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR REACTORS FOR PEACEFUL USES . THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO TO INCREASE OUR OWN OIL PRODUCTION IN WAYS THAT PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES , INCLUDING THOSE THAT USE AND BURY CARBON UNKNOWNWORD , TO RECOVER THE OIL BELOW THE WELLS WE HAVE ALREADY DRILLED , AND TAP OIL , NATURAL GAS , AND SHALE ECONOMICALLY WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT . THE UNITED STATES HAS COAL RESERVES MORE ABUNDANT THAN SAUDI UNKNOWNWORD OIL RESERVES . WE FOUND A WAY TO CUT DOWN UNKNOWNWORD RAIN POLLUTANTS FROM BURNING COAL , AND WE CAN FIND A WAY TO USE OUR COAL RESOURCES WITHOUT EMITTING EXCESSIVE GREENHOUSE GASES . WE CAN ALSO FIND WAYS TO USE NEW SOURCES OF POWER LIKE HYDROGEN . MY ENERGY POLICIES WILL RELY ON SETTING GOOD INCENTIVES FOR FIRMS , ENTREPRENEURS , AND HOUSEHOLDS . BUT THEY WILL NOT SHORTCHANGE THE NEED FOR BASIC RESEARCH TO PROVIDE THE PATHWAY FOR NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY , BETTER MATERIALS , IMPROVED BATTERIES , AND OTHER ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL BE CENTRAL TO RISING TO THIS GREAT CHALLENGE . THE RESEARCH BEING UNKNOWNWORD AT UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR UNKNOWNWORD RESEARCH IS UNLOCKING THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR HYDROGEN UNKNOWNWORD AUTOMOBILES . AND RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD IS ADVANCING THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES . AMERICA COMPETES IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY WHERE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ARE THE PILLARS OF PROSPERITY . THE COMPETITION IS STIFF AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGICAL UNKNOWNWORD TO CAPTURE THE EXPORT MARKETS FOR ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES , UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND GOOD JOBS IT WILL PROVIDE . OUR INNOVATORS , SCIENTISTS , ENTREPRENEURS AND WORKERS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE , RESOURCES , AND DRIVE TO LEAD THE WAY ON ENERGY SECURITY , AS WE HAVE IN SO MANY OTHER WORLD-CHANGING ADVANCEMENTS . THE RACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO THE SWIFT , AND AMERICA MUST BE FIRST TO MARKET WITH INNOVATIONS THAT MEET MANKIND'S GROWING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS . I HAVE PROPOSED A UNKNOWNWORD PLAN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES . IT IS A MARKET-BASED UNKNOWNWORD THAT WOULD SET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON CARBON AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS , AND PROVIDE INDUSTRIES WITH UNKNOWNWORD CREDITS . BY REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS , A UTILITY OR UNKNOWNWORD PLANT CAN GENERATE CREDITS IT MAY TRADE ON THE OPEN MARKET FOR A PROFIT , OFFERING A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO DRIVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND BETTER ENERGY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES ; FOR AUTOMAKERS TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS TO LOWER UNKNOWNWORD AND INCREASE MILEAGE ; FOR UTILITIES TO GENERATE CLEANER ELECTRICITY AND CAPTURE CARBON ; FOR APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTS , AND FOR THE NATION TO USE ENERGY WITH MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY - BUILDING CONSERVATION INTO THE ECONOMY IN A MANNER THAT PRODUCES FINANCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS . AS IT ALWAYS DOES , THE PROFIT MOTIVE WILL ATTRACT THE TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER OF VENTURE CAPITAL , AND UNLEASH THE MARKET TO MOVE CLEAN ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE MARGINS INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD . SOME URGE WE DO NOTHING BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN HOW BAD THE PROBLEM MIGHT BECOME OR THEY PRESUME THE WORST EFFECTS ARE MOST UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR GRANDCHILDREN'S LIFETIME . I'M A PROUD CONSERVATIVE , AND I REJECT THAT KIND OF LIVE-FOR-TODAY , 'ME GENERATION ,' ATTITUDE . IT IS UNWORTHY OF US . AMERICANS HAVE NEVER UNKNOWNWORD CHANGE . WE MAKE CHANGE WORK FOR US . CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD A GLOBAL SOLUTION . AMERICA HAS BOTH AN OBLIGATION AND A UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL INTEREST IN FULFILLING OUR HISTORIC LEADERSHIP ROLE . UNKNOWNWORD CARBON EMISSIONS WILL SOON EXCEED OURS . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA TO MAKE COAL USE CLEANER AND CLIMATE FRIENDLY . BUT , WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM ON OUR TERMS , AND BRING OTHERS INTO THE FOLD OF A COMMON SENSE EFFORT TO SOLVE IT , WHILE WE SELL TO THE WORLD THE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO DO IT . ANSWERING GREAT CHALLENGES IS NOTHING NEW TO AMERICA . IT'S WHAT WE DO . WE BUILT THE ROCKETS THAT TOOK US TO THE MOON NOT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD . WE'VE SENT SPACE PROBES INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE . WE HARNESSED NUCLEAR ENERGY , MAPPED THE HUMAN GENOME , CREATED THE INTERNET AND PIONEERED INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THAT POSSESS THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER OF APOLLO SPACECRAFT ON A SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD CHIP YOU CAN BARELY SEE . WE CAN SOLVE OUR OIL DEPENDENCE AND BECOME MORE ENERGY SECURE . WE CAN LEAVE A CLEANER PLANET FOR THE NEXT GENERATION . YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME THE PROBLEM IS INSURMOUNTABLE . I KNOW MY COUNTRY . I KNOW WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF . WE'RE CAPABLE OF UNIMAGINABLE PROGRESS , UNMATCHED PROSPERITY , AND VISION THAT SEES AROUND THE CORNER OF HISTORY . WE'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD OUR TIMES , UNKNOWNWORD OUR CHALLENGES AND MADE FROM OUR OPPORTUNITIES , ANOTHER BETTER WORLD . MY PEOPLE ARE AMERICANS . OUR TIME IS TODAY . THAT IS THE COUNTRY I ASK TO LEAD . 
RED	THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO YOU . WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT FLORIDA WILL BE IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION , NO LESS SO THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS . AND I THINK REPUBLICANS IN FLORIDA AND REPUBLICANS EVERYWHERE UNDERSTAND THAT WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES AND SOME PRETTY STIFF COMPETITION . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT HARD TO WIN . BUT WE WILL WIN , AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY MAKING CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE IN THIS ELECTION , AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE KEEP AMERICA MOVING FORWARD AND NOT RETURN TO THE FAILED POLICIES OF THE PAST AS OUR FRIENDS IN THE OTHER PARTY WOULD HAVE US DO . WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY BEING HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AMERICA CONFRONTS , AND STRAIGHTFORWARD , BOLD AND BRAVE ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD WE INTEND TO LEAD THE COUNTRY . WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY HAVING THE COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTIONS , AND BY UNKNOWNWORD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD , WAFFLE , MISLEAD , OR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND PROUD . I ONCE LIVED IN THIS GREAT STATE . AND WHEN I WAS AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY ON AN EXTENDED TOUR OF DUTY , MY FLORIDA NEIGHBORS LOOKED AFTER MY FAMILY WITH GREAT CARE AND AFFECTION . I THINK I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA PRETTY WELL . I KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I HAVE TO WIN YOUR RESPECT . AND TO DO THAT , YOU EXPECT ME TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE . YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ME ON EVERY ISSUE , BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU OR UNKNOWNWORD MY INTENTIONS SHOULD I BE SO PRIVILEGED TO BE ELECTED TO THE OFFICE I SEEK . A CANDIDATE WHO TELLS YOU ONE THING AND TELLS ANOTHER GROUP OF VOTERS SOMETHING ELSE , DOESN'T RESPECT YOU , AND WON'T LEAD OUR PARTY TO VICTORY . BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS OUR SELF-RESPECT . I DON'T EXPECT VOTERS TO TRADE UNKNOWNWORD FOR EMPTY PROMISES . AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRADE MINE FOR ANY OFFICE . I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE AND LET THE CHIPS FALL UNKNOWNWORD ERE THEY WILL . AMERICANS ARE WEARY OF EMPTY PROMISES , SPIN AND ELECTION YEAR UNKNOWNWORD . THEY WANT LEADERSHIP , AND LEADERS DON'T PREFER EXPEDIENCY TO PRINCIPLE . THEY DON'T HIDE FROM A CHALLENGE . THEY DON'T PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS BEFORE OUR COUNTRY'S . THEY TELL US WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHERE THEY INTEND TO LEAD . THEY OFFER THEIR HONEST JUDGMENT NOT THEIR POLLSTER'S ADVICE . THEY HAVE CONVICTION , COURAGE , AND , MOST OF ALL , THE HUMILITY TO UNDERSTAND THEY SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST ; THAT OUR MOST SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN US THEIR TRUST BEFORE ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATION . IF I AM PRIVILEGED TO BE YOUR NOMINEE , I PROMISE YOU , I WILL NEVER FORGET MY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND I INTEND TO WIN IT BACK , SO HELP ME GOD . YOU'LL KNOW WHERE I STAND , AND WHERE I INTEND TO LEAD . I WILL DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE , WHOEVER HE OR SHE IS . AND WHEN I DO , I DON'T INTEND TO USE MY PRESIDENCY TO AVOID THE HARDEST CHALLENGES AMERICA FACES , AND LEAVE THEM TO ANOTHER , UNLUCKIER GENERATION OF LEADERS . I DON'T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THE ELECTIONS I WON , FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD I ACHIEVED , OR FOR THE PERSONAL PRIVILEGES I ENJOYED . I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A MAN WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY ; WHO WAS PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY , AND WHOSE COUNTRY WAS PROUD OF HIM . THAT HAS BEEN THE GREAT AMBITION OF MY LIFE . I HAVE NO NEED OF ANY OTHER . AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY I KNOW HOW TO ACHIEVE IT : TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE EVEN WHEN THE ROAD IS LONG AND DIFFICULT ; TO STAND UP FOR MY COUNTRY AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND UNKNOWNWORD ; TO STAND UP UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , DEFIANTLY FOR THE PRINCIPLES , IDEALS AND VIRTUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY "THE LAST , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ." TO WIN THIS ELECTION WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO CAN KEEP THE REPUBLICAN COALITION TOGETHER AND APPEAL TO INDEPENDENTS . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH A REPUTATION FOR CHALLENGING THE WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FAILED POLITICS OF THE PAST . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO IS SURE OF HIS CONVICTIONS ; WHO HASN'T CHANGED HIS POSITIONS ON THE PROFOUND MORAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY TO FIT THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY STRONG AND FREE FROM THE WASTE AND MISUSE OF POLITICIANS FOR WHOM UNKNOWNWORD IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PROSPERITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND , ABOVE ALL , IN A TIME OF WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY FOR WHOM NO ATROCITY IS TOO CRUEL , WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH THE STRONGEST NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE SO THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF VOTERS WHICH CANDIDATE IS BEST PREPARED TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF FROM DAY ONE . WE CANNOT CONCEDE ANY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE DEMOCRATS . BUT NEITHER CAN WE ADOPT THE FLAWED SOLUTIONS THEY PROPOSE OR ABANDON OUR PRINCIPLES IN TELLING AMERICANS HOW WE INTEND TO ADDRESS THEM . WE SHOULD NOT AVOID THE LOOMING BANKRUPTCY OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE MUST NOT PROMISE TO TAX AND SPEND OUR WAY TO GREATER PROSPERITY . WE SHOULD NOT IGNORE PROBLEMS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND GLOBAL WARMING , BUT WE MUST NOT OFFER UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSALS THAT PREFER THE WISDOM OF GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD TO THE POWER OF FREE MARKETS AND THE COMMON SENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WE ARE APPROACHING A "PERFECT STORM " OF PROBLEMS THAT IF NOT ADDRESSED BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT , WILL CAUSE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO UNKNOWNWORD . HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW : WE CURRENTLY 2.2 TRILLION DOLLARS ON HEALTH CARE . BY 2015 , THAT NUMBER WILL NEARLY DOUBLE TO FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS . BY 2019 MEDICARE WILL BE BROKE . WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING MORE ON MEDICARE THAN WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD IN PAYROLL TAXES AND CASHING IN THE FEW IOU'S LEFT IN THE TRUST FUND . BY UNKNOWNWORD MORE MONEY WILL BE GOING OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAN IS COMING IN . THE NEXT PRESIDENT MUST ACT TO AVERT THE IMPENDING "STORM ." I WON'T LEAVE OFFICE WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS THAT SO UNKNOWNWORD THREATEN OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY AND POWER . LAST WEEK I OFFERED MY PLAN TO REFORM AND STRENGTHEN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . IT'S A PLAN BUILT ON A SIMPLE PREMISE : BRINGING SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER CONTROL THROUGH MARKET COMPETITION . IT WILL BENEFIT CONSUMERS AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE ; INCREASE COVERAGE BY MAKING INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE ; AND STRENGTHEN AMERICAN ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ACROSS THE GLOBE . MY PLAN PUTS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FIRST , NOT GOVERNMENT AND INSURANCE BUREAUCRACIES . IT PROMOTES STRONG HEALTH CARE MARKETS BY ALLOWING FAMILIES TO PURCHASE INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES AND THROUGH ANY WILLING PROVIDER SUCH AS AN ASSOCIATION OR A CHURCH . IT TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE OF TORT REFORM TO STOP FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LAWYERS WHILE RAISING HEALTH COSTS FOR EVERYONE ELSE . IT EXPANDS THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF MARKET COMPETITION BY ENCOURAGING A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR BRINGING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DRUGS TO CONSUMERS SOONER AND DEVE LOPING A UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM THAT PERMITS THE SAFE UNKNOWNWORD OF DRUGS TO KEEP COMPETITION UNKNOWNWORD . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY WISELY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . WHEN CONGRESS SENDS ME ONE OF THESE HUGE , PORK BARREL BILLS TO MY DESK , I WILL VETO IT , AND I WILL MAKE THE AUTHORS WHO WROTE IT UNKNOWNWORD . YOU'LL KNOW THEIR NAMES , AND YOU CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE . OF COURSE , THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE THAT WILL CONFRONT THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS DEFENDING AMERICA FROM THE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WHO HATE US AND OUR VALUES , AND WHO WILL DO ANYTHING -- ANYTHING , NO MATTER HOW CRUEL OR VIOLENT -- TO HURT AS MANY AMERICANS AS THEY CAN . THEY ARE AN IMPLACABLE AND UNKNOWNWORD ENEMY FIERCELY DEDICATED TO OUR DESTRUCTION . THEY ARE GLOBAL IN REACH , UNKNOWNWORD IN EUROPE , THE AMERICAS , AFRICA , THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA . JUST LAST MONTH , TERRORIST PLOTS WERE UNCOVERED IN DENMARK AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS . HERE AT HOME WE'VE UNKNOWNWORD PLOTS AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD AIRPORT IN NEW YORK AND AGAINST AMERICAN SOLDIERS AT FT . UNKNOWNWORD . THEY INTEND TO UNKNOWNWORD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO KILL AS MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE AS THEY CAN . THEY WILL NOT RELENT . THEY WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD OF THE FIGHT AND GO AWAY . THEY MUST BE DEFEATED , DEFEATED UTTERLY , WHEREVER THEY ARE . YET MUCH OF WASHING TON REMAINS MIRED IN IRRESOLUTION AND DEFEATISM BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS HARD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND LONG . BUT I AM NOT . I KNOW THE COUNTRY I UNKNOWNWORD TO LEAD . I KNOW ITS STRENGTH . I KNOW ITS VIRTUES . AND I KNOW WE WILL NEVER FACE ANY THREAT STRONGER THAN THE COURAGE , RESOURCEFULNESS , AND DETERMINATION OF FREE PEOPLE , WHO WILL NOT FORGET WHO THEY ARE , LOSE THEIR CONFIDENCE , SUCCUMB TO FEAR , OR LIMIT THEIR DREAMS BECAUSE A UNKNOWNWORD , EVIL ENEMY UNKNOWNWORD THEM TO . THEY WILL MEET AND DESTROY THAT ENEMY , BECAUSE WHAT AMERICANS BELIEVE , WHAT WE KNOW , IS GREAT , TRUE , AND A BLESSING . WE DON'T HIDE FROM HISTORY . WE MAKE HISTORY . THREE DECADES AGO , A VISIONARY POLITICIAN , A MAN OF FIRM CONVICTIONS AND AN ABIDING RESPECT FOR THE VALUES AND STRENGTH OF HIS COUNTRY , DESCRIBED THE DANGERS IN THE WORLD . IT WAS , LIKE TODAY , A TIME WHEN SOME DOUBTED AMERICA'S GOODNESS AND GREATNESS . MANY ARGUED FOR RECONCILIATION WITH OUR GLOBAL ADVERSARY . BUT THIS MAN HELD FIRM . HE DID NOT CARE WHAT EDITORIAL BOARDS WROTE ABOUT HIM . HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT . HE CRITICIZED A FOREIGN POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION . HE CALLED FOR RESOLVE AND UNKNOWNWORD IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION . AND , HE REFUSED TO UNKNOWNWORD MILLIONS TO PERPETUAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FALSE HOPE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE SOVIET UNION WOULD UNKNOWNWORD TO AMERICA'S SECURITY . FORTUNATELY , THIS MAN BECAME PRESIDENT . HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE HAD RONALD REAGAN NOT WON ELECTION IN UNKNOWNWORD AND 1984 ? DOES ANYONE BELIEVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CALLED THE SOVIET UNION AN UNKNOWNWORD EMPIRE " OR WOULD HAVE STOOD UP TO THE NUCLEAR FREEZE MOVEMENT ; WOULD HAVE PROMISED THAT COMMUNISM WOULD BE LEFT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD HEAP OF HISTORY ; WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT A SOVIET LEADER TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL ? WHILE HIS UNKNOWNWORD AND OPPONENTS TRIED TO HIDE FROM HISTORY . RONALD REAGAN SUMMONED US TO MAKE HISTORY ; TO MAKE ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , WHERE OUR INTERESTS WERE SECURE , AND OUR VALUES ASCENDANT . HE WAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FACE OF FIERCE CRITICISM , INTERNATIONAL IRRESOLUTION AND DETERMINED ADVERSARIES . AND HE WAS RIGHT . WE WON THE COLD WAR AS WE WILL WIN THIS NEW AND DANGEROUS WAR : ON OUR TERMS ; FOR THE SAKE OF ALL HUMANITY ; FOR THE RIGHT OF FREE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITHOUT FEAR ; AND WITH THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER , BETTER WO RLD SECURE AND WITHIN OUR REACH . TODAY , THE CHALLENGES ARE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THEY WERE WHEN RONALD REAGAN LED US . AND , TODAY , THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ARE EVERY BIT AS STARK . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE AGAINST FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS ENGAGED IN WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A WAR ON TERROR , OFFER TO ENTER INTO UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR WORST ENEMIES , AND TALK ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THE FORCES OF RADICALISM BY ADVOCATING SURRENDER TO THEM IN IRAQ . IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY IN IRAQ , IF WE CEDE IRAQ TO AL QAEDA , DEATH SQUADS AND IRAN AND SYRIA , HOW LONG WILL THEY STAY THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN ? WE FACE GRAVE CHALLENGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST : HALTING IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS ; PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY , ISRAEL ; SUPPORTING MODERATE VOICES AGAINST THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; DEFENDING LEBANON'S SOVEREIGNTY AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AGGRESSION . DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT IN IRAQ ? IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO THINK SO , AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO DOES ISN'T PREPARED TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY IN THIS CRITICAL HOUR . THE WORLD RONALD UNKNOWNWORD FACED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH UNKNOWNWORD AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS MY FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE FACE AN ENEMY THAT SO UNKNOWNWORD US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . BUT WE ARE AMERICANS , AND WE STILL HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO MAKE HISTORY , A HISTORY IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . LET US ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE THAT HISTORY HAS ASSIGNED TO US , BRAVELY , CONFIDENT IN OUR IDEALS AND PURPOSE , AND SURE OF OUR STRENGTH . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . UNKNOWNWORD WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL -- THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT -- HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION UNKNOWNWORD F THE BEST AMERICANS , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND UNKNOWNWORD CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE FOR US AND FOR THE WORLD . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD UNKNOWNWORD TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE UNKNOWNWORD OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU . 
BLUE	THANK YOU SO MUCH . WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS ENTHUSIASM AND GO RIGHT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TONIGHT . THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS . WE HAVE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED TURNOUT HERE IN IOWA AND THAT IS GOOD NEWS BECAUSE TODAY WE'RE SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE - THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CHANGE AND THAT CHANGE WILL BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN UNKNOWNWORD . I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE RUN WITH SUCH UNKNOWNWORD CANDIDATES . I UNKNOWNWORD SENATOR OBAMA AND SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD . I THANK SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD RICHARDSON AND CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH . TOGETHER WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE CASE FOR CHANGE AND HAVE MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT AMERICA NEEDS A NEW BEGINNING . I AM AS READY AS I CAN BE AFTER HAVING HAD THIS INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE IN IOWA , STARTING OUT A LONG TIME AGO AND MAKING THIS JOURNEY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME MY FRIENDS AND WHO I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND SUPPORT - THOSE FROM IOWA , THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY . AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE EXCEEDING UNKNOWNWORD EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO HAVE THE CAUCUSES THIS YEAR , I THANK YOU . I THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR COMING OUT AND STANDING UP FOR A DEMOCRAT . WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT NOW IS THAT AS WE GO ON WITH THIS CONTEST THAT WE KEEP FOCUSED ON THE TWO BIG ISSUES , THAT WE ANSWER CORRECTLY THE QUESTIONS THAT EACH OF US HAS POSED : HOW WILL WE WIN IN NOVEMBER 2008 BY NOMINATING A CANDIDATE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GO THE DISTANCE AND WHO WILL BE THE BEST PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE ? I AM READY FOR THAT CONTEST . WE HAVE ALWAYS PLANNED TO RUN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EARLY CONTESTS BECAUSE I WANT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA , AND PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATS AND UNKNOWNWORD INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT TO UNDERSTAND - NUMBER ONE - THAT THE STAKES ARE HUGE , THAT THE JOB IS ENORMOUS , BUT THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION . THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL GET INVOLVED AS THEY HAVE HERE IN IOWA - OF ALL AGES . THAT IS WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO UNKNOWNWORD A PRESIDENT , WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY . THAT IS WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO DOING . I HAVE SET BIG GOALS FOR OUR COUNTRY . I WANT TO REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS AND TO ME , THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE HERE AT HOME , BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK AND RAISE THE FAMILIES AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT , WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE AMERICA IN A FEW YEARS . I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I INTEND TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE INHERITED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION , INCLUDING ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AND THEN GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED . WE'RE GOING TO REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT . WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW , BY THE FEW , AND FOR THE FEW , BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR EVERY AMERICAN AGAIN . AND WE'RE GOING TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . I HAVE DONE THIS WORK FOR 35 YEARS . IT IS THE WORK OF MY LIFETIME . I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION AND FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO HAVE HEALTH CARE AND THAT TRANSFORMING WORK IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN . I AM SO READY FOR THE REST OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND I AM SO READY TO LEAD . IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN HAVE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN , THEN I'M YOUR CANDIDATE . AND IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL BREAK THE SHACKLES OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND SET FORTH A NEW SET OF GOALS FOR US TO MEET TOGETHER , THEN I'M YOUR CANDIDATE . AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT , ONCE AND FOR ALL , TAKING ON GLOBAL WARMING ; MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ; THAT WE WILL MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN ; THAT WE WILL BE , ONCE AGAIN , THE COUNTRY OF VALUES AND IDEALS THAT WE CHERISH SO MUCH , THEN PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN . WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT I AM CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC , BOTH ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN BUT MAYBE MORE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY . THIS COUNTRY DESERVES EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVE TO IT . THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T CAUCUS TONIGHT DESPITE THE VERY LARGE TURNOUT . THERE ARE A LOT OF IOWANS WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY . THEY WERE IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN OR SOMEWHERE ELSE SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND THEY NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO RESPECTS THEM AND WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT FORCE SHOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LAST RESORT , NOT A FIRST RESORT . THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AT NIGHT , PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL OR WAITING ON A TABLE IN A RESTAURANT OR MAYBE IN A PATROL CAR KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE AND THEY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS GOING TO CARE ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES . I WROTE A BOOK SOME YEARS AGO CALLED "IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD " AND IN IT I HAVE A CHAPTER THAT I TITLED "EVERY CHILD NEEDS A CHAMPION ." I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS THEIR CHAMPION AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO BE . I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN SO FAR . I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS HERE IN IOWA WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD . I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM ACROSS AMERICA . I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE UNIONS , THE MORE THAN SIX MILLION UNION MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT MY CANDIDACY . I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET UP TOMORROW AND KEEP UNKNOWNWORD AS HARD AS WE CAN TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS LITERALLY THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY . THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR CARING ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS , FOR GIVING OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR RESOURCES , FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS GREAT DEMOCRACY OF OURS DESERVES TO HAVE ALL OF OUR BEST EFFORTS AND I PROMISE YOU , THIS CAMPAIGN THAT I AM RUNNING WILL CERTAINLY HAVE MINE AND I ASK FOR UNKNOWNWORD AS WELL . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH . GOD BLESS YOU . 
BLUE	THANK YOU SO MUCH . I THINK THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO IS JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH . I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO SO MANY OF YOU FOR COMING OUT THIS MORNING AND BEING PART OF THIS EVENT HERE IN JOHNSTON . IT IS VERY UNKNOWNWORD FOR ME TO HAVE SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS FROM MY ENTIRE LIFE WHO HAVE COME OUT HERE TO TALK WITH IOWANS , TO ANSWER QUESTIONS , TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIPS , ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE AND PARTICULARLY AS AN ADULT . THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL INVISIBLE RIGHT NOW . THEY FEEL LIKE NOBODY IS LISTENING . THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO . OR THEY HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD THEIR JOB IS GOING TO BE MOVED OVERSEAS AND THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP GOING . OR THEY ARE COUNTING PENNIES AT THE TABLE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN PAY TO FILL THE TANK IN THEIR CAR OR THEIR TRUCK . I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS OF A PRESIDENT , OF ANYBODY IN PUBLIC LIFE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A PUBLIC TRUST , TO REALLY LISTEN AND TO REACH OUT AND TO LEARN AND TO WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE . TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN , BUT SOMETIMES LIFE HAS A WAY OF UNKNOWNWORD YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD . I WAS LISTENING TO MY FRIENDS TALK AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM . BONNIE CAMPBELL , WHO'S BEEN A LEADER HERE IN IOWA AND DID JUST WONDERFUL WORK FOR OUR COUNTRY WHEN SHE WAS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DURING MY HUSBAND'S PRESIDENCY . I THINK ABOUT HER WITH HER HUSBAND ED , AND HOW DEVOTED SHE IS TO HIM AND HOW CARING SHE IS IN MAKING SURE THAT HE IS ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF AND INCLUDED . THAT KIND OF SUMS UP THE WAY WE ALL LIVE . WE ARE NOT ALL THE SAME IN EVERY SETTING WE FIND OURSELVES , ARE WE ? WHEN YOU'RE WITH YOUR FAMILY , YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK . WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK , YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU'RE AT THE MALL . THAT ALL ADDS UP TO THE PEOPLE WE ARE . EVERY TIME I THINK OF BONNIE CAMPBELL , I THINK ABOUT THE WORK SHE'S DONE FOR THOSE WHO WILL NEVER KNOW HER NAME AND ALL SHE'S DONE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE AND PERSONAL TO HER . I'M VERY PROUD THAT SHE'S MY FRIEND . JEFF UNKNOWNWORD IS SOMEONE WHO CAME INTO MY LIFE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS DURING HURRICANE KATRINA . I WAS GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE HIM SOME HELP , SOME ADVICE , SOME INFORMATION WHEN HE WAS , AS ANY PERSON WOULD BE , WORRIED ABOUT HIS FAMILY . WHEN I MET HIM HE STARTED OUT BY SAYING 'I'M A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN .' I SAID 'WELL , THAT'S OK , MY DAD WAS A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN . BUT HE EVOLVED .' I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW JEFF AND HIS FAMILY AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR HIS SUPPORT . IT MEANS A LOT TO ME TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WE'VE GOT TO CROSS PARTY LINES . THAT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS , WE START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AGAIN AND ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS TOGETHER . [APPLAUSE ] I SO APPRECIATE SHANNON COMING ALL THIS WAY BECAUSE SHE HAS A VERY DEMANDING LIFE AND HER WONDERFUL DAUGHTER IS GETTING SUCH LOVE AND ATTENTION FROM A MOM WHO UNKNOWNWORD HER , WHO DOES EVERYTHING SHE CAN FOR HER . I'VE MET A LOT OF MOMS LIKE SHANNON OVER MANY YEARS , WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN . I'VE MET A LOT OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PERSON THEY LOVE THE MOST , A CHILD WHO'S BEEN STRICKEN WITH AN UNKNOWNWORD MAYBE THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF , OR HAD AN ACCIDENT , AND NOW NEEDS SO MUCH CARE . THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I THINK EVERY ONE OF US CAN RELATE TO , WHETHER ANYTHING TRAGIC AND BAD HAS HAPPENED TO US PERSONALLY , WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE FACED THE SAME DILEMMA THAT SHANNON AND HER FAMILY FACED . I BELIEVE I HAVE A GREAT HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE IN PUBLIC OFFICE . WHAT I TRY TO DO EVERYDAY IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP SOMEBODY . YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PASS THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU WANT TO PASS RIGHT AWAY . YOU CAN'T SNAP YOUR FINGERS AND GET PEOPLE TO COOPERATE . YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THAT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY . BUT YOU CAN TRY TO HELP SOMEBODY EVERY SINGLE DAY . I HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT AS A PUBLIC SERVANT , AS AN UNKNOWNWORD , AND NOW AS A SENATOR AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT . BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE LIKE SHANNON AND SO MANY OTHERS WHO DESERVE OUR HELP . MY FRIEND BESTY , WHOM I MET IN 6TH GRADE - IN MRS . UNKNOWNWORD CLASS - HAS BEEN WITH ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN , THAT'S NOT JUST A REFLECTION ON HOW WE LOOK TODAY . ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES AND THE NOT SO GOOD TIMES , WE BOTH HAVE TO DO BETTER ON THE OTHER PART . IN JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL , I UNKNOWNWORD REALLY THICK GLASSES , WHICH I REALLY HATED . THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME BOY OR ANOTHER THAT I WAS HOPING WOULD NOTICE ME , SO I USED TO TAKE THEM OFF AND THAT MEANT I DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING . BETSY WOULD ARRANGE TO MEET ME SO THAT WE COULD WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY TOGETHER SO I WOULD NOT BUMP INTO A UNKNOWNWORD , BUT ALSO SO SHE COULD SAY , 'DON IS ON THE RIGHT .' I COULD SAY , 'HI , DON ,' LIKE I ACTUALLY DID SEE HIM . SHE'S BEEN GUIDING ME AROUND EVER SINCE . I'M SO PLEASED SHE COULD BE HERE . SHE AND HER FAMILY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO MINE . EACH ONE OF US COULD TELL STORIES LIKE THIS , ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU . HERE IN IOWA , I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME FLAVOR OF WHO I AM OUTSIDE OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS - WHEN ALL OF THE CAMERAS AND THE LIGHTS DISAPPEAR , WHAT I DO WHEN NOBODY'S LISTENING OR TAKING NOTES , AND RECORDING IT . BECAUSE IT IS HARD WHEN YOU'RE IN PUBLIC LIFE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SHARING EXPERIENCE WITH THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE . ON OUR 99-COUNTY BLITZ , WHICH WE STARTED YESTERDAY , I'M GOING TO GET TO AS MANY PLACES AS I CAN , BUT SO ARE MY FRIENDS . AND PEOPLE WHOM I'VE WORKED WITH , AND FOR , OVER A LIFETIME . I THINK THIS ELECTION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE EVER HAD . THERE'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY FACING IOWANS BECAUSE YOU GET TO MAKE THE FIRST CHOICE . NOT JUST THE COUNTRY , BUT THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING . WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP . BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHANGING WHO LIVES IN THE WHITE HOUSE , IT'S HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO LEAD TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ALL OF US KNOW ARE NECESSARY . I'VE BEEN MAKING CHANGE MY ENTIRE LIFE . FOR 35 YEARS AS AN ADULT , I'VE WORKED TO TRY TO HELP KIDS WITH DISABILITIES GET INTO PUBLIC SCHOOLS BACK IN THE EARLY UNKNOWNWORD WHEN I WORKED FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . I WORKED IN ARKANSAS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION , AND I HAVE FRIENDS FROM ARKANSAS WHO ARE HERE TODAY WHO HAVE BEEN DEAR FRIENDS TO ME . I KNOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY BEYOND WHERE IT IS TO WHAT IT CAN BE . I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SPEND THOSE EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS PART OF THE TEAM AROUND MY HUSBAND , AND TO WORK ON EXPANDING HEALTH CARE TO EVERY AMERICAN - QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE . THAT'S A HARD JOB . LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED - HARRY TRUMAN , EVEN RICHARD NIXON - BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT'S THE SMART DECISION FOR US TO MAKE AS A NATION . BUT WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL THAT FIRST TIME . BUT I THINK YOU ACTUALLY LEARN MORE ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL THAN IF THEY JUST SLOPE THROUGH LIFE . I HAD A CHOICE : I COULD HAVE SAID 'OK , WE DIDN'T DO IT , I'M NOT TRYING ANYMORE .' OR , WHAT I DECIDED TO DO WAS TO SAY 'OK , WE DIDN'T DO IT , LET'S REGROUP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET DONE .' THAT'S WHY I WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OUR CHILDREN WERE IMMUNIZED , AND THAT DRUG COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO TEST DRUGS BEFORE THEY GAVE THEM TO CHILDREN . THEN I WENT TO WORK TO HELP CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND NOW 6 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE HEALTH CARE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT OTHERWISE'WE'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME THE PRESIDENT'S VETOES OF GIVING HEALTH CARE TO EVEN MORE CHILDREN . IN THE SENATE I HAVE WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES AND I HAVE DONE THAT IN ORDER TO GET WORK DONE THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE . BETSY WAS KIDDING ABOUT THE WAY I IMMERSE MYSELF IN ALL OF THE ISSUES AFFECTING NEW YORKERS INCLUDING DAIRY FARMERS , OUR FRUIT AND UNKNOWNWORD FARMERS , AND SO MANY ELSE . FOR ME IT IS ABOUT GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND WORKING AS HARD AS YOU CAN SO THAT WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE , I TEAMED UP WITH A REPUBLICAN SENATOR , UNKNOWNWORD GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA . OVER THE OPPOSITION OF THE PENTAGON AND THE OPPOSITION OF THE WHITE HOUSE , WE PASSED HEALTH CARE FOR GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS , LIKE SO MANY WHO HAVE LEFT HERE FROM IOWA . WHEN WE SAW THAT OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WERE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING CALLED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND REALIZED THAT NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION , I WENT TO WORK . I WROTE AND HELPED TO PASS THE FIRST LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSED THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROBLEM . WHEN WE STARTED HEARING ABOUT HOW FAMILIES - WHEN THEY HAD AN INJURED SON OR DAUGHTER COMING BACK FROM WAR , THEY COULDN'T TAKE ENOUGH TIME OFF FROM WORK WITHOUT LOSING THEIR JOB TO BE THERE BY THE SIDE OF THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER - I TEAMED UP WITH UNKNOWNWORD DODD AND REPUBLICANS AND WE PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE FAMILY LEAVE ACT SO IF YOU'RE SON OR YOUR DAUGHTER IS INJURED , YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT LOSING YOUR JOB . YOU ARE PROTECTED . YOU CAN BE THERE DURING THAT MOST IMPORTANT UNKNOWNWORD . THESE ARE REAL PROBLEMS THAT REAL AMERICANS FACE . THERE'S NOTHING ABSTRACT ABOUT IT . IT'S WHAT I HEAR ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY . EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT CHANGE IN THIS ELECTION . PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU CAN GET CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU CAN GET CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT . I BELIEVE THE WAY YOU GET CHANGE IS BY WORKING HARD FOR IT . PERSISTENCE , PERSEVERANCE , EVEN SOME PERSPIRATION - THAT IS HOW YOU CHANGE LIVES , YOU CHANGE INSTITUTIONS . THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE . THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT . BECAUSE I INTEND TO GIVE AMERICA A NEW BEGINNING . THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE . [APPLAUSE ] AND THEN WE DO HAVE TO GET TO WORK , DON'T WE ? WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING IN HEALTH CARE . I HAVE PROPOSED A PLAN , THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE . AND HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK . IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD WITH IT , NOTHING CHANGES . BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR IF THE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU HAVE DOESN'T COVER WHAT'S CALLED A PREEXISTING CONDITION ; YOU'RE A DIABETIC AND IT WON'T COVER YOUR DIABETES . YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION AND IT WON'T COVER YOUR HEART CONDITION . SO IT'S REALLY NOT INSURING YOU FOR WHAT YOU NEED MOST . IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE . YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE NEW CHOICES . I WANT TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO EVERY AMERICAN . IT'S A GOOD PLAN . OVER 250 CHOICES , PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY CHOICES THAT YOU CAN DECIDE HOW BEST SUITS YOU AT AN AVERAGE COST BELOW WHAT YOU CAN GET THROUGH AN UNKNOWNWORD OR IN THE PRIVATE MARKETPLACE . EVERY FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HAS ACCESS TO THIS PLAN AND YOU PAY FOR IT BECAUSE YOU PAY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF IT , BECAUSE IT IS PAID FOR OUT OF TAX DOLLARS . ABOUT 75 % OF IT . I FIGURE IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO HAVE THOSE SAME CHOICES AT THE SAME AFFORDABLE COST . WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE UNKNOWNWORD IT WITH HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS . WE'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE PREVENTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOW NOT PAYING FOR PREVENTION AND UNKNOWNWORD WE PAY MORE WHEN SOMEBODY GETS REALLY SICK . WE'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE UNKNOWNWORD CARE MANAGEMENT , WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY ILL . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RECORDS , SOMETHING I WORKED ON WITH NEWT GINGRICH AND BILL FRIST WHICH RAISED SOME EYEBROWS IN WASHINGTON . I BELIEVE WE CAN MOVE TOWARD A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT COVERS EVERYONE , THAT DECREASES COSTS FOR EVERYONE , AND IMPROVES QUALITY FOR EVERYONE . WHEN I WAS FINALIZING MY HEALTH CARE PLAN , THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID TO ME , 'YOU KNOW TRYING TO COVER EVERYBODY IS CONTROVERSIAL . IT'S GOING TO ENGENDER ALL OF THE USUAL TALKING POINTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE . SO YOU REALLY UNKNOWNWORD START BEING SO AMBITIOUS . I ASKED PEOPLE , 'IN OTHER WORDS , YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE OUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM MY HEALTH CARE PLAN ?' WELL OK , WHO DO WE LEAVE OUT ? DO WE LEAVE OUT SHANNON'S DAUGHTER , ISABELLA ? PEOPLE SAY THAT SHE HAS A DETERIORATING CONDITION . MAYBE WE JUST LEAVE HER OUT OF HEALTH CARE . DO WE LEAVE OUT THE YOUNG COUPLE I MET IN WEBSTER CITY WHO OWN AN AUTO BODY SHOP ? THEY CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR KID . THEY'RE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN . MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEM OUT AND HOPE THEY STAY HEALTHY . OR MAYBE I SHOULD LEAVE THE NURSE OUT FROM WATERLOO I MET , WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER . THE TREATMENT MADE HER REALLY SICK . SHE COULDN'T GO TO WORK . BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK TO WORK , SHE FOUND OUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB ANYMORE . WHEN SHE LOST HER JOB , SHE LOST HER HEALTH CARE . MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE HER OUT . I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS . I WANT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS , ONCE AND FOR ALL AND I WANT TO START BY SETTING FORTH A PLAN THAT WILL DO THAT . [APPLAUSE ] MAYBE WE CAN GET A NEW BEGINNING IN ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING . THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE TO ACT ON . WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THOSE WHO PRODUCE OIL . THEY'VE GOT US OVER A BARREL , THE OIL BARREL . THAT BARREL IS NOW ABOUT $100 A BARREL . IT WAS $20 WHEN GEORGE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT . NOW WE ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE MONEY SENDING IT TO COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN TURN AROUND AND USE THAT MONEY AGAINST US . I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER . I HAVE PROPOSED A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR SECURITY , THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN OUR ATMOSPHERE , AND THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY . I BELIEVE IF YOU JUST FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF IOWA , AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE HERE WITH BIO-FUELS AND WIND , WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS ACROSS AMERICA . THESE ARE JOBS THAT CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED . THESE ARE JOBS THAT WILL BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND RIGHT HERE IN OUR NATION . THAT'S THE KIND OF ENERGY FUTURE THAT I'M UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE . WE SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD THIS LIKE THE APOLLO MOON SHOT . WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL , THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR SIGHTS AND IT ALSO CREATED A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT OF SPINOFF . THE INTERNET ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE ON THE SPACE PROGRAM . WHO KNOWS WHAT WE WILL UNKNOWNWORD IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING . LET'S UNLEASH THE INNOVATIVE GENIUS OF AMERICA AGAIN . THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN'T DO IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT . [APPLAUSE ] I WANT A NEW BEGINNING IN EDUCATION . EDUCATION BEGINS IN THE FAMILY AND WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES GET THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN . THAT'S ALSO WORK THAT I'VE DONE A VERY LONG TIME . GOING BACK TO MY UNKNOWNWORD YEARS WHEN THROUGH MY CHURCH , I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AFFECTING SMALL CHILDREN THAT HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES , THAT HAD SOME UNKNOWNWORD TO OVERCOME . I WANT TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES . I WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM , AGAIN - LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN IOWA TO HELP EVERY CHILD , ESPECIALLY FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS GET BETTER PREPARED . AND I WANT TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WHICH HAS INTERFERED WITH LEARNING AND TEACHING . [APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE TO START REIMAGINING EDUCATION . IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY . I GO INTO CLASSROOMS ACROSS AMERICA . I WAS IN A SCHOOL IN IOWA HERE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON THAT WAS DIFFERENT AND NEW AND THERE WERE COMPUTERS , BUT THE CLASSROOMS LOOKED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THEY LOOKED WHEN I WAS THERE WITH BETSY BACK IN 6TH GRADE . LET'S START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO TAILOR INSTRUCTION MORE TO MEET UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN'S NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY CHILD LEARNS DIFFERENTLY . I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP GIVE EACH CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ACTUALLY WORK WITH TEACHERS , AND WORK WITH OTHERS WHO CARE ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION THE RIGHT WAY . AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES . LET'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE KIDS WHO WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL . I MEET THEM ALL OVER IOWA . WHO SAY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO AFFORD IT . THEY HAVE TO GO INTO SUCH DEEP DEBT . I WANT EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO IS WILLING TO WORK HARD TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO THAT . I ALSO DON'T WANT TO FORGET THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR KIDS WILL NOT GO TO COLLEGE . LET'S START TAKING CARE OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO THE HARD WORK THAT KEEPS THE ECONOMY GOING , WHO FIGHT OUR WARS , WHO TAKE CARE OF US , WHO PROTECT US . [APPLAUSE ] EDUCATION IS STILL THE PASSPORT TO OPPORTUNITY AND WE NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT PASSPORT , 21ST CENTURY , AND START MAKING IT WORK AGAIN . WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO REFORMING OUR GOVERNMENT . NO MORE NO-BID CONTRACTS , AND CRONYISM , AND CORRUPTION , AND INCOMPETENCE , AND INSENSITIVITY . EVERY ONE OF US IS A CUSTOMER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . I SURE DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN GETTING VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER . WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY , NOT JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGED AND THE CONNECTED . THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE , BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION . HOW ABOUT ELECTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAIN ; PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO , ARE COMMITTED TO DOING IT , AND CAN DELIVER RESULTS ? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING TO AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN . WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL . WE'RE GOING TO THANK THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY WERE ASKED TO DO . [APPLAUSE ] BUT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION . WE SHOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQI CIVIL WAR . IT IS UP TO THE IRAQIS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THEY WILL HAVE TO DO JUST THAT . [APPLAUSE ] WHEN OUR TROOPS COME HOME , WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM . A LOT WILL BE NEEDING HEALTH CARE . THEY HAVE BEEN INJURED AND WOUNDED . SOME OF IT VISIBLE . THEY'VE LOST ARMS AND UNKNOWNWORD . THEY'VE BEEN BLINDED . SOME OF IT IS NOT SO VISIBLE . IT'S THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY . IT'S THE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER . A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS AT UNKNOWNWORD READE VISITING WITH SOLDIERS WHO HAD COME BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND I MET A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG ARMY UNKNOWNWORD , WHO HAD LOST HIS RIGHT ARM IN BAGHDAD AND LOST THE RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND WHEN HIS WEDDING RING MELTED INTO HIS FINGER . I SAID , UNKNOWNWORD , HOW ARE YOU DOING ? UNKNOWNWORD IT COMING FOR YOU ?' HE SAYS , 'YOU KNOW , I'M LEARNING HOW TO USE THE UNKNOWNWORD . I'M FIGURING IT OUT . THEY'RE REALLY HELPFUL . THEY'RE TEACHING ME WHAT TO DO .' AND THEN HE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD WHERE DO I GO TO GET MY BRAIN BACK ?' BECAUSE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD DEVICES , THAT KILL AND MAIM SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN , ALSO PRODUCE A UNKNOWNWORD EFFECT . A PHYSICAL SHAKING OF THE BRAIN . HE SAID , 'I WENT TO WEST POINT . I NEVER HAD ANYBODY TAKE CARE OF ME . NOW MY WIFE HAS TO GIVE ME A LIST EVERY MORNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO , OF WHAT I DO NEXT , OF WHAT I DO THEN .' SO I WORKED TO GET LEGISLATION PASSED TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES . I WILL PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES CARE OF OUR VETERANS . I THINK IT IS DISGRACEFUL THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING MONTHS FOR APPOINTMENTS . THEY CAN'T GET THEIR UNKNOWNWORD CLAIMS UNKNOWNWORD . THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO EITHER KNOW OR UNKNOWNWORD ANY CONCERN . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , VETERANS ARE GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TREATMENT . AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , BUT ALL OUR VETERANS , PARTICULARLY FROM MY OWN GENERATION WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM , WHO NEVER GOT THE WELCOME AND THE HELP THAT THEY DESERVED TO HAVE . [APPLAUSE ] WE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING IN AMERICA . BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS , AND ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MY CAMPAIGN , WITHOUT YOUR HELP . ON JANUARY 3RD YOU HAVE A BIG DECISION . I WAS THRILLED AND HONORED TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER . THEY PUT US THROUGH OUR UNKNOWNWORD ]. [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MORE GRUELING PROCESS . THEY NOT ONLY INTERVIEWED 18 OF US ONCE , THEY INTERVIEWED UNKNOWNWORD OF US TWICE , PLUS THEY DID RESEARCH , PLUS THEY ASKED PROBING QUESTIONS IN OTHER SETTINGS WHERE THEY REALLY WERE TAKING OUR MEASURE . I WAS IN UNKNOWNWORD YESTERDAY AT A SALE UNKNOWNWORD , A LIVESTOCK SALEBARN . I'VE BEEN IN SALE BARNS OFTEN , PARTICULARLY IN ARKANSAS . I WAS STANDING UP WHERE THEY SHOW THE CATTLE AND I SAID UNKNOWNWORD NEVER BEEN IN THIS POSITION UNKNOWNWORD BUT THAT'S THE WAY I FELT . I THOUGHT OK , YOU WANT TO LOOK INSIDE MY MOUTH . ALRIGHT , HAVE AT IT .' BUT AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS THEY MADE THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY . WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING . EVERYBODY UNKNOWNWORD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES , UNKNOWNWORD , DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO . BUT THE REGISTER SAID WHAT I BELIEVE - THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE . WE DON'T HAVE A MARGIN FOR UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL ALWAYS MAKE UNKNOWNWORD , WE'RE HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO FOR PROVEN LEADERSHIP , THAT'S BEEN TESTED , THAT IS READY ON DAY ONE . I OFFER THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA FOR THESE CAUCUSES . I HOPE YOU WILL DECIDE TO GO AND STAND UP FOR ME IN YOUR CAUCUS . I'M SO EXCITED BY THE GROWING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM AND PEOPLE COMING ON UNKNOWNWORD FROM ACROSS THE STATE . ONE DAY I MET A 17 YEAR OLD WHO WAS JUST ABOUT TO TURN 18 , WHO IS GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME AND I HEARD ABOUT A 102-YEAR OLD MAN WHO IS DETERMINED TO GO TO THE CAUCUSES AND HAS MADE HIS 81-YEAR OLD SON PROMISE TO TAKE HIM . I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND UP FOR ME FOR ONE NIGHT AND I WILL STAND UP FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN . STANDING UP FOR OUR VALUES , OUR PRINCIPLES , FOR THE KIND OF CHANGE WE NEED TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER JUST AS I DID IN NEW YORK . THEN I WILL STAND UP EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE . I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU , AND ABOUT YOUR FAMILY , ABOUT YOUR JOB , AND YOUR HEALTH CARE . I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD . AND TOGETHER WE WILL NOT ONLY MAKE HISTORY , BUT WE WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN THE COUNTRY WE LOVE . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH . 
BLUE	THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE , BACK IN COUNCIL BLUFFS , WITH ALL OF YOU , ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS LIKE CONNIE GRONSTAL AND HER DAUGHTER KATE AND HER HUSBAND MIKE . UNKNOWNWORD A GREAT LEADER OF MY CAMPAIGN . BOTH SHE AND KATE HAVE BEEN JUST DEVOTED AND WORKING HARD . I'M SURE THEY'VE UNKNOWNWORD A LOT OF YOU TO BE PART OF THE TEAM WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER . AND I ALSO AM ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED PERSONALLY TO HAVE MY FRIEND OF 25 YEARS , BOB KERREY , UNKNOWNWORD ME WITH SUCH A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE . AS CONNIE SAID , BOB HAS GIVEN A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY . HE HAS LITERALLY BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES FIGHTING AND STANDING UP AND ADVOCATING FOR THE VALUES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THIS GREAT COUNTRY'S JOURNEY TOWARD PROGRESS . I ALSO WANT TO ADD , IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE HAS DONE , HE SERVED WITH GREAT DISTINCTION ON THE 9/11 UNKNOWNWORD . THAT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF US IN NEW YORK . HE TRIED TO GET TO THE TRUTH ; HE TRIED TO HOLD PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE . BOB AND I HAVE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFE , TO DETER AND DEFEAT TERRORISM AND TO MAKE OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE . BOB KERREY IS THE EMBODIMENT OF PATRIOTISM IN ACTION . AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH HIM BACK ACROSS THE RIVER FROM NEBRASKA WHERE HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION AS HE SETS FORTH THE REASONS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF MY CANDIDACY . HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP . HE'S GOT SOME EXPERIENCE IN TOUGH FIGHTS , SO I AM THRILLED TO HAVE HIM ON MY TEAM . THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH BOB . WE ARE KICKING OFF TODAY OUR "EVERY COUNTY COUNTS " TOUR RIGHT HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS . OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS , I AND MY FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WILL BLANKET IOWA . WE'RE GOING TO BE IN ALL UNKNOWNWORD COUNTIES . WE'RE GOING TO BE KNOCKING ON DOORS AND MAKING PHONE CALLS , VISITING UNKNOWNWORD HOMES , THEIR PLACES OF WORK , ALL WITH A VERY SIMPLE BUT URGENT MESSAGE - THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT BEGINS HERE IN IOWA . IOWANS HAVE AN UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBILITY , ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR . BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO WILL BE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE , THAT'S IMPORTANT , BUT EVEN MORE SO , WHO IS READY TO BE PRESIDENT AND WHO IS READY , WILLING , AND ABLE ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB THAT WE NEED DONE . SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR 99-COUNTY BLITZ . I'M ACTUALLY EVEN GOING TO GET IN A HELICOPTER AFTER I LEAVE YOU . WE'RE CALLING IT A UNKNOWNWORD ," AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COVER MORE GROUND THAT WAY . BUT I HAVE FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME WHO HAVE COME TO IOWA TO HELP ME , INCLUDING MY BEST FRIEND FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH WHOM I AM STILL VERY CLOSE , PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED WITH IN ARKANSAS , NEW YORK , ACROSS THE COUNTRY , AND I AM THRILLED TO UNKNOWNWORD THEM TO IOWA AND TO HAVE SO MANY IOWANS HEAR THEIR STORIES ABOUT WHY THEY WOULD TAKE TIME FROM THEIR BUSY LIVES TO COME HERE ON MY BEHALF . I WAS ESPECIALLY HONORED BY THE ENDORSEMENT THIS MORNING OF MY CANDIDACY BY THE DES MOINES REGISTER . IT WAS AN IMPORTANT EVENT IN THIS PROCESS . I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE ZEROED IN ON THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT , BY MY VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY , MY PLANS FOR CHANGE , AND MY ABILITY TO LEAD . NOW WITH BOB UNKNOWNWORD ENDORSEMENT , WITH CONGRESSMAN UNKNOWNWORD BOSWELL'S ENDORSEMENT OF A FEW DAYS AGO , OUR CAMPAIGN IS ENERGIZED , WE'RE PICKING UP MOMENTUM , AND WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 3RD WITH YOUR HELP . I CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT GROWING AND IT REALLY SPANS ALL AGES . I WAS TALKING TO AN IOWAN ON THE PHONE AS I WAS DRIVING FROM THE AIRPORT TO COME HERE AND HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DAUGHTER IS TURNING 18 BEFORE THE CAUCUSES , THEY LIVE IN DES MOINES , AND SHE'S GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME . THEN I GOT A REPORT THAT A 102-YEAR OLD MAN IS ALSO GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME . WE ARE APPEALING TO EVERY GENERATION . AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY IN AMERICA COMMITTED TO THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TOGETHER . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO ME THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AND NOW IN THEIR SECOND CENTURY WILL CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE FUTURE TO SAY "YOU KNOW WHAT , NO MATTER HOW INCONVENIENT IT IS , HOW DIFFICULT IT MIGHT BE , UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WEATHER , I WANT TO BE THERE TO STAND UP FOR UNKNOWNWORD CLINTON ." AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE WHOLE LIVES ARE BEFORE THEM UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION . SO I COULD NOT BE MORE PUMPED UP . I AM THRILLED AT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND GROWING SUPPORT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE . BUT AS BOB KERREY SAID , WE HAVE TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO ACTION ON JANUARY 3RD . AND I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU A CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY BECAUSE AS I ALSO AM REACHING OUT AND MEETING WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE , AND TRAVELING ALL THOSE MILES , I HAVE TO RELY ON ALL OF YOU THE WAY I RELY ON CONNIE AND KATE TO BE MY EYES , MY EARS , REALLY TO SPEAK FOR ME . AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE WHAT A CRITICAL ELECTION THIS IS . AND THAT I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT BASED ON MY 35 YEARS OF WORK , MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED , MY COMMITMENT TO APPLY THE PERSISTENCE , THE PERSEVERANCE , AND YES , THE PERSPIRATION TO GET IT DONE . BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA TODAY . I GREW UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO , RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDWEST . MY FATHER CAME HOME AFTER SERVING IN THE NAVY FOR FIVE YEARS AND HE WANTED TO DO THREE THINGS : HE WANTED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS , HE WANTED TO START A FAMILY , AND HE WANTED TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE . MY MOTHER , WHO DIDN'T HAVE A VERY EASY UPBRINGING , SHE WANTED TO GIVE HER CHILDREN SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO DO AND THAT WAS TO GO TO COLLEGE . SO WE LIVED THE MIDDLE CLASS VALUES . WE UNDERSTOOD , AS MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME , THAT WE HAD TO WORK HARD , BE UNKNOWNWORD , BE RESILIENT , BUT ALSO TO BE COMPASSIONATE AND CARING . TO BE PART OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN , PARTICULARLY EVERY CHILD , A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . WELL MY 88-YEAR OLD MOTHER , GOD BLESS HER , STILL LIVES WITH ME . I BROUGHT HER OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD AND SHE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME THAT SHE DECIDED SHE MIGHT DO A LITTLE MORE OF THAT IF SHE HAD ENOUGH REST IN BETWEEN STOPS . BUT AS WE TRAVELED AROUND , IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER TO ME OF THE COMMITMENT I FEEL TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR YEARS AND THOSE WHO ARE AT THE VERY DAWN OF THEIR LIVES , ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO PURSUE THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ALL OF US . AND SO I RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA TODAY , CERTAINLY HERE IN IOWA , WHOM I'VE MET . THEY'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND CONCERNS WITH ME , AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD THEY FEEL UNKNOWNWORD AND INSECURE . THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER LIFE WILL BE BETTER FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN . THEY ASK THEMSELVES EVERYDAY : "WHY IS IT NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE THAT I'M WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN AND I'M NOT GETTING AHEAD ? THAT I DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR MYSELF OR MY CHILDREN ; THAT MY JOB HAS BEEN OUTSOURCED AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO GET ANOTHER ONE ." THESE ARE THE REAL LIFE CONCERNS THAT IOWANS HAVE SHARED WITH ME OVER THE PAST ELEVEN MONTHS . I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . EVERYONE WILL BE SEEN , RESPECTED , HEARD . AND JUST AS I'M SAYING THAT EVERY COUNTY COUNTS IN MY CAMPAIGN , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COUNT ON ME WHEN I AM YOUR PRESIDENT . I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO THAT DAY TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER , TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY FAIRER , TO RESTORE SHARED PROSPERITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY , TO RESTORE OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD AND TO GIVE AMERICANS BACK OUR PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE SO VERY MUCH . AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH , AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE . WE ARE READY FOR A NEW BEGINNING . NOW IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE QUESTION . WHO IS READY AND ABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE NEED STARTING ON DAY ONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ? AUDIENCE : YOU ARE . WELL , SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT . I BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY WORKING HARD FOR IT . THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE ALL MY LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU . I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE REAL CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF THE REAL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND CARE ABOUT , THAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR FOR 35 YEARS . NOW THAT HARD WORK DEMANDS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND WHEN TO FIND COMMON GROUND . IF YOU'RE TOO UNYIELDING , YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING DONE . NOT IN AMERICA ; WE'RE NOT A DICTATORSHIP . YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE . BUT IF YOU DON'T STAND UP AND REFUSE TO UNKNOWNWORD ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT , THEN YOU COULD LOSE OUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE . SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE IT ; HOW TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND . FOR 35 YEARS I HAVE BEEN A CHANGE-MAKER AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE TO DO FOR ALL OF YOU AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN . NOW FOR ME THAT MEANS THAT I STARTED WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL , NOT GOING TO WORK FOR A BIG CORPORATE LAW FIRM BUT GOING TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . AND I DID THAT BECAUSE I WATCHED AND LEARNED ABOUT MY MOTHER'S LIFE . THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO WORK AS A MOTHER'S HELPER WHEN SHE WAS UNKNOWNWORD AND IT WAS HARD . AND I BELIEVE THAT KIDS SHOULD BE GIVEN A BETTER SHOT THAN THAT , AND THAT A LOT OF KIDS DRAW THE UNKNOWNWORD STRAW IN LIFE . ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WORKED ON WAS GOING DOOR TO DOOR , TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE MISSING CHILDREN WERE . MISSING NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD KIDNAPPED THEM BUT MISSING BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN SCHOOL . BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S YOU COULD LOOK AT UNKNOWNWORD FIGURES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO LIVED IN A PARTICULAR AREA . THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FIGURES AND THERE WERE CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE AREA WHO WEREN'T IN SCHOOL AND NOBODY COULD FIGURE OUT WHY . AND I FOUND OUT WHY . I FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND , CHILDREN WHO WERE DEAF , CHILDREN IN UNKNOWNWORD , CHILDREN WITH OTHER KINDS OF DISABILITIES . THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THEM IN A BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL LIKE THIS . SO I WORKED WITH MANY OTHERS TO CHANGE THE LAW , TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES TO GET A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND I WAS PROUD TO BE PART OF MAKING CHANGE THAT HELPED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS . IN ARKANSAS I WORKED TO EXPAND RURAL HEALTH CARE INTO SOME OF THE POOREST PLACES IN THE STATE . I WORKED TO REFORM SCHOOLS SO IF YOU WERE A POOR CHILD LIVING IN A REALLY POOR AREA OF ARKANSAS YOU OFTEN WOULD GO TO A SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , IT DIDN'T HAVE ADVANCED UNKNOWNWORD , OR CHEMISTRY , IT DIDN'T HAVE FOREIGN LANGUAGES . SO NO MATTER HOW UNKNOWNWORD YOU WERE , NO MATTER HOW HARD WORKING YOU WERE WILLING TO BE , YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR A FIRST CLASS EDUCATION . SO WE CHANGED THAT . WE CHANGED THE STANDARDS . WE IMPROVED EDUCATION AND UNKNOWNWORD OBSERVERS SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD IN THE COUNTRY . BECAUSE , YOU SEE , I KNEW THAT TO MAKE CHANGE YOU HAD TO WORK WITH PEOPLE , TO RAISE UNKNOWNWORD SALARIES AND TO EXPAND THE UNKNOWNWORD , SO THOUSANDS OF ARKANSAS STUDENTS NOW HAVE AN EDUCATION THAT WAS DENIED TO UNKNOWNWORD GENERATIONS AND I AM PROUD THAT I WAS PART OF MAKING THOSE CHANGES AS WELL . AND AS I CONTINUED TO WORK , I CHAIRED THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW WASN'T SOME CRUEL HOAX IN AMERICA . THAT IF YOU WERE POOR AND YOU HAD A LEGITIMATE LEGAL PROBLEM , YOU WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WOULD GIVE YOU YOUR DAY IN COURT . AND I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT I COULD , IN 1993 , WORK WITH A LOT OF VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE TO TRY TO BRING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO OUR COUNTRY . NOW WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT I AM VERY PROUD WE TRIED BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT AGAIN . I TRAVELED TO BEIJING AS FIRST LADY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU , TO STAND UP FOR A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION - THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS . IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT WE BELIEVE , HERE IN OUR COUNTRY , IT'S WHAT WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY . COUNTRIES THAT UNKNOWNWORD WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS ARE OFTEN COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH , AREN'T THEY ? SO WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES AND MAKE SURE THOSE VALUES ARE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD , AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CHANGES ON BEHALF OF WOMEN THAT ARE GOOD AND RIGHT FOR WOMEN AND SMART FOR AMERICAN SECURITY . I WROTE A BOOK CALLED "IT TAKES A VILLAGE ," BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE , ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD A BETTER COUNTRY FOR OUR CHILDREN . I WAS PLEASED TO TURN ALL OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THAT BOOK - OVER A MILLION DOLLARS - TO CHILDREN'S CHARITIES . BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT WE DO IN OUR GOVERNMENT THAT COUNTS , IT'S WHAT WE DO IN OUR DAILY LIVES . HOW WE SUPPORT CHARITABLE UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE THERE WITH A HELPING HAND FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED IT . AND I WANT , AS PRESIDENT , TO INSPIRE MORE PHILANTHROPY , TO GET MORE AMERICANS INVOLVED IN HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS . THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO , AND WE WANT TO HARNESS WHAT IS REALLY THE GENIUS OF OUR COUNTRY - THE WILLINGNESS OF OUR CITIZENS TO GIVE OF THEMSELVES . WHEN WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL WITH HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE , I DID NOT GIVE UP . I SOMETIMES THINK YOU CAN TELL MORE ABOUT A PERSON WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO AFTER THEY DON'T SUCCEED THAN IF THEY HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED . BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE WHO PULL THEMSELVES UP , DON'T WE ? WHO GET UP AFTER BEING KNOCKED DOWN AND KEEP GOING . AND THAT IS WHAT I DID WHEN I HELPED TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT PROGRAM OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF KIDS AND NOW GEORGE BUSH HAS VETOED OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND IT . WELL , I'LL TELL YOU , WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT , WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CHILD . IN THE SENATE , I HAVE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO MAKE CHANGE . WHEN I WAS ELECTED , THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME AND IT WAS A GREAT HONOR THAT THEY DID . BUT I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GO AND GET THINGS DONE . I COULDN'T JUST SAY , 'WE'LL I'VE BEEN ELECTED , THANK YOU VERY MUCH .' THAT'S NOT WHO I AM THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO . SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK , EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR RURAL AREAS FOR OUR FARMERS IN OUR SMALL UNKNOWNWORD . WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE WITH REPUBLICANS TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT . WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A NATIONAL EMERGENCY SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN YOU HIT 911 ON YOUR CELL PHONE , SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW WHERE YOU WERE . WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES WE HAVE IN PHILOSOPHY OR IDEOLOGY , THAT WE CANNOT LET PARTISANSHIP STAND IN THE WAY OF IMPROVING THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY . I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS , AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS , TO CREATE A NEW BEGINNING FOR AMERICA . THAT NEW BEGINNING WILL ONCE AND FOR ALL GIVE US UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE . EVERYDAY PEOPLE COME UP TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS . THEY TELL ME HORROR STORIES ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT REJECT THEIR CLAIMS , ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD GOING UP SO FAST AND HIGH THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES , ABOUT BEING WITHOUT INSURANCE , NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE TREATMENT THAT THEIR DOCTORS SAY ARE NEEDED . I LISTEN TO SO MANY OF THESE STORIES AND IT JUST STRENGTHENS MY RESOLVE THAT WE WILL PUT TOGETHER A GREAT COALITION OF BUSINESS AND LABOR , OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND TOGETHER WE WILL TAKE ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES . AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME . THE STORIES THAT I HEAR , THE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS THAT I HAVE CONVINCE ME THAT NOTHING OTHER THAN HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE SHOULD BE THE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I WAS WORKING ON MY HEALTH CARE PLAN THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL , THAT'S POLITICALLY RISKY , WHY DON'T YOU JUST CUT YOURSELF A LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD HERE . IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT TO LEAVE PEOPLE OUT - THAT'S A BETTER POLITICAL CASE TO MAKE ." I SAID UNKNOWNWORD SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ? WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WHO IS LEFT OUT ?" SHOULD I LEAVE OUT PEOPLE LIKE DAWN CARSTENS AND HER HUSBAND GREG FROM WEBSTER CITY ? THEY RUN THEIR OWN AUTO BODY SHOP . THEY WORK REALLY LONG HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE . SHOULD I TELL THEM JUST TO ROLL THE DICE ? SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ELLEN DUFFY ? A NURSE I MET IN WATERLOO DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER . HER UNKNOWNWORD MADE HER SO SICK SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY CONTINUE TO WORK AND WHEN SHE FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD AND TRIED TO GO BACK TO WORK THE HOSPITAL TOLD HER SHE NO LONGER HAD A JOB , SHE LOST HER HEALTH INSURANCE . WHO SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ? I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON THIS PROBLEM . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE IT . AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THAT CASE . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR OUR SENIORS . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE UNKNOWNWORD SECURITY FOR WORKING AMERICANS . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE . I WILL GO AFTER THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT SWINDLE SENIORS OUT OF THEIR MONEY , SOMETIMES OUT OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS . I WILL GO AFTER THOSE NURSING HOMES THAT ABUSE OUR SENIORS . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE HOME HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTABLE ALTERNATIVES . I WANT TO PROVIDE A UNKNOWNWORD TAX CREDIT FOR UNKNOWNWORD WHO DO THE HARD WORK OF CARING FOR NOT ONLY AGING FAMILY MEMBERS BUT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES . THIS IS A LABOR OF LOVE . IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS ANY OF US WILL EVER DO AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR IT . I WAS IN WINTERSET TWO WEEKS OR SO AGO AND THERE WAS A MAN THERE AND A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR AND THE MAN WAS STANDING BEHIND HER WITH HIS HANDS ON THE BACK OF THE WHEELCHAIR . OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD REACH OVER AND GIVE HER A UNKNOWNWORD , OCCASIONALLY WIPE HER MOUTH . AND I CALLED ON HIM WHEN QUESTION TIME CAME . HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR 50 YEARS , THAT SHE'S HAD PARKINSON'S FOR UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AND IT GOT INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO CARE FOR HER , HE TRIED TO GET LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE , NOBODY WOULD HELP HIM WITH HIS WIFE . ALL HE'S LOOKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP . HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF HER , THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER A REALLY LONG TIME . BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD IF HE DOESN'T GET HELP AT ALL . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE HELP TO LOVING FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE HIM AND SO MANY OTHERS WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING . WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GET A NEW BEGINNING ON ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING . THIS IS A SECURITY ISSUE . WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL . THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE . AREN'T YOU PROUD OF AL GORE GETTING THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR HIS WORK ON GLOBAL WARMING ? WELL , WE NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT THAT HE AND MANY OTHERS HAVE MADE TO ACTION . SO I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT , TO MOVE TOWARD HOMEGROWN ENERGY JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE IN IOWA WITH BIOFUELS AND WIND , PROMOTE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY . I WANT TO APPLAUD THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS . WE'VE RAISED GAS MILEAGE STANDARDS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES . SO THERE'S ENOUGH WORK FOR US TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PLANET , TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMY AND TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY . AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOOD NEWS IS ? IF WE DO THIS WE'LL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR OUR ECONOMY . WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS . WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR UNIONS . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE TAX CUTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM , NOT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T . AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD SO WE DON'T GIVE INCENTIVES TO THOSE WHO OUTSOURCE JOBS AND WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO MOVE TOWARD TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT DO HAVE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS SO IT'S NOT A RACE TO THE UNKNOWNWORD BUT A REAL MOVE OF LIFT TO THE TOP . WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY , SOMETHING THAT BOB KERREY WHEN HE WAS SENATOR HAD AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN MAKING POSSIBLE . AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED . UNDER THIS PRESIDENT , ALL OF THAT HARD WORK HAS BEEN SQUANDERED . WELL WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO RECLAIMING OUR FUTURE BY STOPPING THE MORTGAGING OF OUR COUNTRY AND HAVING US UNKNOWNWORD BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO AND EVERY PLACE IN BETWEEN . AND WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING ON EDUCATION . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION , SOMETHING THAT CONNIE HAS WORKED ON HER ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE . WE NEED TO BUILD STRONGER FAMILIES . WE NEED TO HAVE MORE EARLY INTERVENTION . WE NEED TO HELP PARENTS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR OWN CHILDREN . THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE WORKED ON FOR DECADES . I BROUGHT A PROGRAM TO ARKANSAS , THE HOME INSTRUCTION FOR PRESCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM , THAT GAVE PARENTS THE TOOLS THEY NEEDED TO HELP THEIR OWN CHILDREN . BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR US TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A CHILD'S LIFE . AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THAT REACHES THOSE KIDS PARTICULARLY WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED TO GIVE THEM EVEN MORE HELP AND SUPPORT . AND WE'RE GOING TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND . AND I HAVE PLEDGED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO GOES AND IS MOTIVATED . WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE . HOW ABOUT MORE JOB TRAINING ? MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ? LET'S GIVE THEM THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE FOR A GOOD JOB AND A GOOD FUTURE . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING IN REFORMING OUR GOVERNMENT . I'M GOING TO END THE CRONYISM AND THE NO-BID CONTRACTS FOR HALLIBURTON . WE'RE GOING TO END THE KIND OF WAR ON SCIENCE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS WAGED . IT'S TIME WE START ACTUALLY INVESTING IN SCIENCE AGAIN . SO HOW ABOUT LIFTING THE BAN ON UNKNOWNWORD CELL RESEARCH ? AND HOW ABOUT MAKING AMERICA THE INNOVATION NATION AGAIN ? WE CAN CREATE SO MUCH IF WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SYSTEM . AND I HAVE THE IDEA I'VE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD ALL ACROSS IOWA . HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN AFTER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ? FINALLY WE WILL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . IT WILL START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL BE A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE THAT GOES OUT ACROSS THE WORLD - THE ERA OF UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY IS OVER . WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING WITH PEOPLE AGAIN . BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOU . I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR TRUST . AND I NEED EVERY ONE WHO IS READY FOR CHANGE TO GO TO THE CAUCUSES ON JANUARY 3RD . IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE , YOU'RE TIRED OF PAYING THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR YOUR GAS EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO FILL UP YOUR CAR OR YOUR TRUCK , YOU'RE TIRED OF SEEING THE ECONOMY UNKNOWNWORD MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE ALREADY WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED - IF YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE NO INVISIBLE AMERICANS , THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME . IF YOU CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD TO SEE OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN , OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS , CONTINUING TO FIGHT ANOTHER COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR , IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS IS TO BRING THEM HOME - BUT YOU WANT TO BE SURE IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY - THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND AND CAUCUS FOR ME . IF YOU WANT TO GET OUR COUNTRY BACK INTO THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS , IF YOU BELIEVE OUR FUTURE CAN BE BETTER THAN OUR UNKNOWNWORD OR OUR PAST , IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THAT PRIDE AGAIN IN AMERICA , THEN I NEED YOU TO GO STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME . BECAUSE IF YOU WILL GO AND DO THAT ON JANUARY 3RD , I PROMISE YOU I WILL STAND AND WAGE A WINNING CAMPAIGN FOR OUR VALUES AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND THEN WHEN I AM ELECTED , I WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY . LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH . 
BLUE	LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NOW , YOU WILL GO INTO THE VOTING BOOTH AND YOU WILL SELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . NOW , HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS - THE NAME GEORGE W . BUSH WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . THE NAME OF MY COUSIN UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HIDE THAT FOR A LONG TIME . EVERYBODY HAS A BLACK SHEEP IN THE FAMILY . THE ERA OF SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE , AND BROWNIE INCOMPETENCE , AND KARL ROVE POLITICS WILL FINALLY BE OVER . BUT THE QUESTION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU VOTE THIS YEAR AND NEXT IS THIS : "WHAT'S NEXT FOR AMERICA ?" WE ARE IN A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . THE PLANET IS IN PERIL . THE DREAM THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR UNKNOWNWORD AS IF IT'S SLOWLY SLIPPING AWAY . WE ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS . WE'VE NEVER PAID MORE FOR HEALTH CARE OR FOR COLLEGE . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE AND IT'S HARDER TO UNKNOWNWORD . AND MOST OF ALL WE'VE LOST FAITH THAT OUR LEADERS CAN OR WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . WE WERE PROMISED COMPASSIONATE UNKNOWNWORD AND ALL WE GOT WAS KATRINA AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE WERE PROMISED A UNITER , AND WE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO COULD NOT EVEN LEAD THE HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT VOTED FOR HIM . WE WERE PROMISED A MORE ETHICAL AND MORE EFFICIENT WASHINGTON , AND INSTEAD WE HAVE A TOWN THAT IS MORE CORRUPT AND MORE WASTEFUL THAN IT WAS BEFORE . AND THE ONLY MISSION THAT WAS EVER ACCOMPLISHED IS TO USE FEAR AND FALSEHOOD TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY TO A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN UNKNOWNWORD AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN WAGED . IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT AMERICA IS LISTENING , INTENTLY , TO WHAT WE SAY HERE TODAY - NOT JUST DEMOCRATS , BUT REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO'VE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT , BUT WANT TO BELIEVE AGAIN . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT WE NOT ONLY HAVE A MOMENT OF GREAT CHALLENGE , BUT ALSO A MOMENT OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY . WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A NEW MAJORITY - TO FINALLY TACKLE PROBLEMS THAT GEORGE BUSH MADE FAR WORSE , BUT THAT HAD UNKNOWNWORD LONG BEFORE GEORGE BUSH EVER TOOK OFFICE - PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR . AND THAT IS WHY THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON TEXTBOOK CAMPAIGNS JUST WON'T DO IN THIS ELECTION . AN ELECTORAL STRATEGY THAT STARTS OUT LEAVING HALF THE COUNTRY BEHIND JUST WON'T DO . TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR INSTEAD OF TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR JUST WON'T DO . TRIANGULATING AND POLL-DRIVEN POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MITT OR RUDY MIGHT SAY ABOUT US JUST WON'T DO . IF WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WINING THIS ELECTION DEMOCRATS , WE CAN'T LIVE IN FEAR OF LOSING IT . THIS PARTY - THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON AND JACKSON ; OF ROOSEVELT AND KENNEDY - HAS ALWAYS MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE LED , NOT BY POLLS , BUT BY PRINCIPLE ; NOT BY UNKNOWNWORD , BUT BY CONVICTION ; WHEN WE SUMMONED THE ENTIRE NATION TO A COMMON PURPOSE - A HIGHER PURPOSE . AND I RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THAT'S THE PARTY AMERICA NEEDS US TO BE RIGHT NOW . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST OFFER CHANGE AS A UNKNOWNWORD , BUT REAL , MEANINGFUL CHANGE - CHANGE THAT AMERICA CAN BELIEVE IN . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . I AM IN THIS RACE TO TELL THE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS THAT THEIR DAYS OF SETTING THE AGENDA IN WASHINGTON ARE OVER . I HAVE DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE TO TAKE ON LOBBYISTS - AND WON . THEY HAVE NOT UNKNOWNWORD MY CAMPAIGN , THEY WILL NOT GET A JOB IN MY WHITE HOUSE , AND THEY WILL NOT DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I'M IN THIS RACE TO TAKE THOSE TAX UNKNOWNWORD AWAY FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS AND PUT THEM IN THE POCKETS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS WHO DESERVE IT . AND I WON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE EVERY TEN YEARS UNKNOWNWORD WILL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE SO THAT WORKERS DON'T ' FALL BEHIND . THAT IS WHY I AM IN IT . I'M IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I WANT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE OUTRAGE OF 47 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE AND START ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT . I UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS BY BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER . BY TAKING ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . AND I HAVE PUT FORTH A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT WILL DO MORE TO CUT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE THAN ANY OTHER PROPOSAL IN THIS RACE . HERE'S THE TRUTH - IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT NOW , YOU WILL WHEN I'M PRESIDENT . ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE IS MORE INTERESTED IN UNKNOWNWORD POINTS THAN SOLVING PROBLEMS . AND I'M IN IT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT . I RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CHILD HAS THE BEST EDUCATION THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER - FROM THE DAY THEY ARE BORN TO THE DAY THEY GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE . AND I WON'T JUST TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT TEACHERS ARE - AS PRESIDENT I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THEM FOR THEIR GREATNESS - BY RAISING SALARIES AND GIVING THEM MORE SUPPORT . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I AM SICK AND TIRED OF DEMOCRATS THINKING THAT THE ONLY WAY TO LOOK TOUGH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IS BY TALKING , AND ACTING , AND VOTING LIKE GEORGE BUSH REPUBLICANS . WHEN I AM THIS UNKNOWNWORD NOMINEE , MY OPPONENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I VOTED FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ ; OR THAT I GAVE GEORGE BUSH THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON IRAN ; OR THAT I SUPPORTED UNKNOWNWORD POLICIES OF NOT TALKING TO LEADERS THAT WE DON'T LIKE . AND HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I UNKNOWNWORD ON SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OK FOR AMERICA TO TORTURE - BECAUSE IT IS NEVER OK . THAT'S WHY I AM IN IT . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE WAR IN IRAQ . WE WILL HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME IN SIXTEEN MONTHS . I WILL CLOSE GUANTANAMO . I WILL RESTORE HABEAS UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL FINISH THE FIGHT AGAINST AL QAEDA . AND I WILL LEAD THE WORLD TO COMBAT THE COMMON THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY - NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORISM ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND I WILL SEND ONCE MORE A MESSAGE TO THOSE YEARNING FACES BEYOND OUR UNKNOWNWORD THAT SAYS , "YOU MATTER TO US . YOUR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND OUR MOMENT IS NOW ." AMERICA , OUR MOMENT IS NOW . OUR MOMENT IS NOW . I DON'T WANT TO SPEND 2008 UNKNOWNWORD THE SAME FIGHTS THAT WE HAD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MITT AND RUDY WANT . THAT'S THEY'RE ONLY HOPE OF WINNING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT HEALTH CARE , OR ENDING THIS WAR , OR MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE , THEN THEY WILL LOSE . THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE SAME BITTER PARTISANSHIP AND THE SAME ELECTORAL MAP WE'VE HAD FOR FAR TOO LONG . I BELIEVE I CAN TRANSFORM THAT MAP . IN MY SENATE RACE I WON SOME OF THE REDDEST , MOST REPUBLICAN COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS . IN 2006 , WHEN HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATES IN STATES LIKE MISSOURI , AND NEBRASKA , AND UNKNOWNWORD , AND VIRGINIA , AND UNKNOWNWORD NEEDED SOMEONE TO COME CAMPAIGN FOR THEM , I WAS THE ONE THEY CALLED . AND I'M ATTRACTING MORE INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS TO OUR CAUSE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THIS CAMPAIGN . IT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD THAT NEW MAJORITY - NOT JUST TO WIN , BUT TO GOVERN - TO ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE . I DON'T WANT TO PIT RED AMERICA AGAINST BLUE AMERICA , I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AND THAT WON'T JUST BE A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ; THAT WILL BE AN AMERICAN VICTORY . AND THAT IS A VICTORY AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW . I AM NOT IN THIS RACE TO UNKNOWNWORD SOME LONG-HELD AMBITIONS OR BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S SOMEHOW UNKNOWNWORD TO ME . I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE , I ALWAYS KNEW THIS JOURNEY WAS IMPROBABLE . I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A JOURNEY THAT WASN'T . I AM RUNNING IN THIS RACE BECAUSE OF WHAT DR . UNKNOWNWORD CALLED "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW ." BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO LATE . AND THAT HOUR IS ALMOST UPON US . I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND FIND OUT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STILL LACK HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT THE OCEANS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD A FEW MORE INCHES . THE PLANET HAS REACHED A POINT OF NO RETURN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO STOP BUYING OIL FROM DICTATORS . I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE AMERICAN LIVES PUT AT RISK BECAUSE NO ONE HAD THE JUDGMENT OR THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST A MISGUIDED WAR BEFORE WE SENT OUR TROOPS INTO FIGHT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE HOMELESS VETERANS ON THE STREETS . I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANOTHER GENERATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN TO FAILING SCHOOLS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR MY DAUGHTERS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR YOUR SONS . I DO NOT WANT THAT FUTURE FOR AMERICA . I'M IN THIS RACE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR JOBS FOR THE JOBLESS AND HOPE FOR THE HOPELESS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO ; FOR THE SAME REASON I FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER ; FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR ILLINOIS FAMILIES FOR OVER A DECADE . BECAUSE I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M STANDING HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE SOMEBODY , SOMEWHERE STOOD UP FOR ME WHEN IT WAS RISKY . STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS HARD . STOOD UP WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR . AND BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY STOOD UP , A FEW MORE STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW UNKNOWNWORD STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW MILLION STOOD UP . AND STANDING UP , WITH COURAGE AND CLEAR PURPOSE , THEY SOMEHOW UNKNOWNWORD TO CHANGE THE WORLD . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING , DEMOCRATS - TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THE SAME CHANCES SOMEBODY GAVE ME . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING - TO KEEP THE AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE FOR THOSE WHO STILL UNKNOWNWORD FOR OPPORTUNITY , WHO STILL THIRST FOR EQUALITY . THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND WITH ME , THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME , THAT'S WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO STOP UNKNOWNWORD FOR WHAT THE UNKNOWNWORD SAY WE HAVE TO ACCEPT . IN THIS ELECTION - IN THIS MOMENT - LET US REACH FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE . A NATION HEALED . A WORLD REPAIRED . AN AMERICA THAT BELIEVES AGAIN . THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY . 
BLUE	GOOD AFTERNOON . LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT UNKNOWNWORD THIS HAS BEEN BILLED AS AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I STAND BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT OPPOSED TO WAR IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES . THE CIVIL WAR WAS ONE OF THE BLOODIEST IN HISTORY , AND YET IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE OF THE SWORD , THE SACRIFICE OF MULTITUDES , THAT WE COULD BEGIN TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNION , AND DRIVE THE SCOURGE OF SLAVERY FROM OUR UNKNOWNWORD . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . MY GRANDFATHER UNKNOWNWORD UP FOR A WAR THE DAY AFTER PEARL HARBOR WAS BOMBED , FOUGHT IN PATTON'S ARMY . HE SAW THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE FIELDS OF EUROPE ; HE HEARD THE STORIES OF FELLOW TROOPS WHO FIRST ENTERED AUSCHWITZ AND UNKNOWNWORD . HE FOUGHT IN THE NAME OF A LARGER FREEDOM , PART OF THAT ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY THAT TRIUMPHED OVER EVIL , AND HE DID NOT FIGHT IN VAIN . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH , AFTER WITNESSING THE CARNAGE AND DESTRUCTION , THE DUST AND THE TEARS , I SUPPORTED THIS UNKNOWNWORD PLEDGE TO HUNT DOWN AND ROOT OUT THOSE WHO WOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE NAME OF INTOLERANCE , AND I WOULD WILLINGLY TAKE UP ARMS MYSELF TO PREVENT SUCH TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . AND I KNOW THAT IN THIS CROWD TODAY , THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF PATRIOTS , OR OF PATRIOTISM . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS A DUMB WAR . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS A RASH WAR . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS THE UNKNOWNWORD ATTEMPT BY RICHARD PERLE AND PAUL WOLFOWITZ AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WARRIORS IN THIS ADMINISTRATION TO SHOVE THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD AGENDAS DOWN OUR UNKNOWNWORD , IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COSTS IN LIVES LOST AND IN HARDSHIPS BORNE . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS THE ATTEMPT BY POLITICAL HACKS LIKE KARL ROVE TO DISTRACT US FROM A RISE IN THE UNINSURED , A RISE IN THE POVERTY RATE , A DROP IN THE MEDIAN UNKNOWNWORD - TO DISTRACT US FROM CORPORATE SCANDALS AND A STOCK MARKET THAT HAS JUST GONE THROUGH THE WORST MONTH SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION . THAT'S WHAT I'M OPPOSED TO . A DUMB WAR . A RASH WAR . A WAR BASED NOT ON REASON BUT ON PASSION , NOT ON PRINCIPLE BUT ON POLITICS . NOW LET ME BE CLEAR - I SUFFER NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN . HE IS A BRUTAL MAN . A RUTHLESS MAN . A MAN WHO BUTCHERS HIS OWN PEOPLE TO SECURE HIS OWN POWER . HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD DEFIED UN RESOLUTIONS , UNKNOWNWORD UN INSPECTION TEAMS , DEVELOPED CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS , AND COVETED NUCLEAR CAPACITY . HE'S A BAD UNKNOWNWORD . THE WORLD , AND THE IRAQI PEOPLE , WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SADDAM POSES NO IMMINENT AND DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES , OR TO HIS NEIGHBORS , THAT THE IRAQI ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES , THAT THE IRAQI MILITARY A UNKNOWNWORD OF ITS FORMER STRENGTH , AND THAT IN CONCERT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HE CAN BE CONTAINED UNTIL , IN THE WAY OF ALL PETTY DICTATORS , HE FALLS AWAY INTO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY . I KNOW THAT EVEN A SUCCESSFUL WAR AGAINST IRAQ WILL REQUIRE A US UNKNOWNWORD OF UNDETERMINED LENGTH , AT UNDETERMINED COST , WITH UNDETERMINED CONSEQUENCES . I KNOW THAT AN INVASION OF IRAQ WITHOUT A CLEAR RATIONALE AND WITHOUT STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT WILL ONLY UNKNOWNWORD THE FLAMES OF THE MIDDLE EAST , AND ENCOURAGE THE WORST , RATHER THAN BEST , IMPULSES OF THE ARAB WORLD , AND STRENGTHEN THE RECRUITMENT ARM OF AL QAEDA . I AM NOT OPPOSED TO ALL WARS . I'M OPPOSED TO DUMB WARS . SO FOR THOSE OF US WHO SEEK A MORE JUST AND SECURE WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN , LET US SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FINISH THE FIGHT WITH BIN LADEN AND AL QAEDA , THROUGH EFFECTIVE , UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE , AND A SHUTTING DOWN OF THE FINANCIAL NETWORKS THAT SUPPORT TERRORISM , AND A HOMELAND SECURITY PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN COLOR-CODED WARNINGS . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UN INSPECTORS CAN DO THEIR WORK , AND THAT WE VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE A NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY , AND THAT FORMER ENEMIES AND CURRENT ALLIES LIKE RUSSIA SAFEGUARD AND ULTIMATELY UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL , AND THAT NATIONS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND INDIA NEVER USE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS ALREADY IN THEIR POSSESSION , AND THAT THE ARMS MERCHANTS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY STOP FEEDING THE COUNTLESS WARS THAT RAGE ACROSS THE GLOBE . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO MAKE SURE OUR UNKNOWNWORD ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST , THE SAUDIS AND THE UNKNOWNWORD , STOP OPPRESSING THEIR OWN PEOPLE , AND SUPPRESSING UNKNOWNWORD , AND TOLERATING CORRUPTION AND INEQUALITY , AND MISMANAGING THEIR ECONOMIES SO THAT THEIR YOUTH GROW UP WITHOUT EDUCATION , WITHOUT PROSPECTS , WITHOUT HOPE , THE READY RECRUITS OF TERRORIST CELLS . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO WEAN OURSELVES OFF MIDDLE EAST OIL , THROUGH AN ENERGY POLICY THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY SERVE THE INTERESTS OF EXXON AND UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE ARE THE BATTLES THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT . THOSE ARE THE BATTLES THAT WE WILLINGLY JOIN . THE BATTLES AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD AND INTOLERANCE . CORRUPTION AND GREED . POVERTY AND DESPAIR . THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR ARE DIRE , THE SACRIFICES IMMEASURABLE . WE MAY HAVE OCCASION IN OUR LIFETIME TO ONCE AGAIN RISE UP IN DEFENSE OF OUR FREEDOM , AND PAY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR . BUT WE OUGHT NOT -- WE WILL NOT -- TRAVEL DOWN THAT UNKNOWNWORD PATH BLINDLY . UNKNOWNWORD SHOULD WE ALLOW THOSE WHO WOULD UNKNOWNWORD OFF AND PAY THE UNKNOWNWORD SACRIFICE , WHO WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THE FULL MEASURE OF UNKNOWNWORD WITH THEIR BLOOD , TO MAKE SUCH AN AWFUL SACRIFICE IN VAIN .
