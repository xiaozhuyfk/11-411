BLUE	WELL I AM SO HONORED AND PERSONALLY UNKNOWNWORD TO BE HERE , AND I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER THIS WEEK AROUND WORLD UNKNOWNWORD DAY . AND I WANT TO THANK THEIR TREMENDOUS UNKNOWNWORD AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND EVERYONE WHO HELPED MAKE THIS UNKNOWNWORD . I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR COMMITMENT ABOUT DEALING WITH THE GLOBAL SCOURGE OF UNKNOWNWORD . I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE TWO FIRST UNKNOWNWORD : THE FIRST LADY OF UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FIRST LADY OF UNKNOWNWORD . I AM UNKNOWNWORD THAT THEY ARE HERE UNKNOWNWORD THEIR COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE . AND FIRST , [APPLAUSE ] LET ME FIRST SAY HOW UNKNOWNWORD BILL AND I WERE TO HEAR THAT UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - AND HOW UNKNOWNWORD AND MOVED WE WERE TO HEAR ABOUT THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT YOU GAVE THOSE WHO WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE . IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THIS CHURCH IS NOT UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . YES , THE UNKNOWNWORD ARE BIG , THEY'RE CERTAINLY UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IT'S UNKNOWNWORD BY YOUR IMPACT . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD BY THE MEANING THAT YOU GIVE TO LIVES HERE WITHIN THIS UNKNOWNWORD AND SO FAR BEYOND ITS UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU DEMONSTRATE BOTH TO OUR FAITH IN GOD AND TO DOING HIS WORK HERE ON EARTH IS UNKNOWNWORD AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THAT I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY . YOU KNOW , UNKNOWNWORD HAS HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE WITH HIS LESSONS FOR A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JOURNEY . BUT HE KNOWS THOSE UNKNOWNWORD DAYS ARE JUST THE BEGINNING . MY OWN FAITH JOURNEY IS APPROACHING A HALF A CENTURY , AND I KNOW HOW FAR I STILL HAVE TO GO . BUT I HAVE BEEN BLESSED IN MY LIFE , BOTH STARTING IN MY FAMILY AND IN THE CHURCH OF MY CHILDHOOD , TO BE UNKNOWNWORD EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WAY . A MOTHER , WHO TAUGHT UNKNOWNWORD SCHOOL AND MADE SURE THAT MY UNKNOWNWORD AND I WERE THERE THE MINUTE THE CHURCH DOORS UNKNOWNWORD . A FATHER , WHO UNKNOWNWORD BY THE SIDE OF HIS UNKNOWNWORD EVERY NIGHT OF HIS LIFE TO SAY HIS UNKNOWNWORD . A MINISTER OF OUR YOUTH UNKNOWNWORD , WHO TOOK IT AS PART OF HIS MISSION TO SHOW THE GROUP OF WHITE , UNKNOWNWORD , MIDDLE CLASS KIDS THAT THERE WAS A UNKNOWNWORD WORLD OUTSIDE . AND A UNKNOWNWORD GROUP THAT UNKNOWNWORD FOR ME UNKNOWNWORD AFTER I CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE - A GROUP OF UNKNOWNWORD WOMEN , BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS , WHOSE LOVE AND SUPPORT UNKNOWNWORD ME . I'VE OFTEN BEEN ASKED IF I'M A UNKNOWNWORD PERSON AND I HAVE ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE RAISED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF UNKNOWNWORD , BUT , HAD I NOT BEEN , UNKNOWNWORD ONE WEEK IN THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ME INTO ONE . UNKNOWNWORD ] IT'S WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER OF UNKNOWNWORD IS THERE FOR SO MANY OF US . ONE OF MY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD IS THAT UNKNOWNWORD LINE IN UNKNOWNWORD THAT FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WORKS WITHOUT FAITH IS JUST TOO HARD . IT CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD OVER UNKNOWNWORD LIFE OR OVER THE GENERATIONS . AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE HOW HERE , IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING , FAITH AND WORK COME TOGETHER . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT . OR AS UNKNOWNWORD MIGHT SAY : UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WHAT UNKNOWNWORD IMPORTANT WORK YOUR FAITH UNKNOWNWORD - FIGHTING AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CORRUPT LEADERSHIP , POVERTY , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD . UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO , WHEN MEN - UNKNOWNWORD YOUNG UNKNOWNWORD MEN - BEGAN UNKNOWNWORD FROM A UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAD NO NAME , WE COULD NOT HAVE , AND CERTAINLY DID NOT , TALK ABOUT IT IN CHURCH . IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD . IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD . IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD FOR SO MANY OF US . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD ITSELF WAS NOT UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD IT DID NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY . IT ONLY MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE , BECAUSE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD AND FEAR AND , LET'S BE HONEST , ON UNKNOWNWORD . WE ARE TAUGHT TO UNKNOWNWORD THE SICK . TO LOVE THEM AS OUR OWN . BUT UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO , TOO MANY UNKNOWNWORD ALONE , UNKNOWNWORD TO TELL THEIR FAMILIES WHAT HAD MADE THEM ILL . IN THE UNKNOWNWORD , WE LEARN THAT UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD THE SICK . AND IF YOU READ THOSE UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ILL , IT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CLEAR THAT UNKNOWNWORD HAD A CHOICE . HE COULD HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY . HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF THE DAY . I DON'T NEED TO DO THIS ; I'VE ALREADY DONE IT IN UNKNOWNWORD SO I DON'T NEED TO DO IT AGAIN . BUT HE MADE THE CHOICE . HE NEVER ASKED WHY SOMEONE WAS SICK . HE JUST HEALED AND UNKNOWNWORD THOSE IN NEED . THAT IS WHAT UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD TOO . OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD , TO HELP , TO UNKNOWNWORD . FOR MANY OF US THE UNKNOWNWORD RULE CALLS ON US TO ACT . AND SO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY . NOT ONLY CAN WE TALK ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD IN CHURCH , BUT UNKNOWNWORD ARE LEADING THE WAY . THANKS TO LEADERS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AMONG US , AND HAVE FOUGHT THE UNKNOWNWORD ITSELF . WE'VE HAD BREAKTHROUGHS IN TREATMENT THAT ALLOW THOSE WITH THIS UNKNOWNWORD TO LIVE MUCH LONGER , AND WE ARE HOPING FOR BREAKTHROUGHS IN UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . BUT LET US NOT GROW UNKNOWNWORD OR TOO UNKNOWNWORD . LET US NOT FEEL THAT BECAUSE WE'RE HERE AT THIS UNKNOWNWORD OR AS A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD OR SOME OTHER CHURCH UNKNOWNWORD TODAY THAT WE ARE DOING OUR PART , BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO . HERE IN AMERICA , WE STILL HAVE AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RATES ARE RISING AMONG UNKNOWNWORD MEN AGAIN AND AMONG UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD TAKES A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE POOR AND UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR BLACK WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AROUND THE WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD REMAINS A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IN TOO MANY PLACES , UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD REMAINS STRONG . AND WHERE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD LIVE , THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH THE WORLD VISION VILLAGE , I WAS TOLD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD - A YOUNG UNKNOWNWORD BOY WHO LOST FIRST HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER TO WHAT IS CALLED THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ." AND FOR YEARS HIS UNKNOWNWORD HAD TOLD HIM HE DID NOT HAVE IT . BUT AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER , HE BEGAN TO UNKNOWNWORD , FINALLY WAS TESTED AND FOUND OUT HE WAS UNKNOWNWORD . EVEN BEFORE THE UNKNOWNWORD RESULTS CAME IN , THE BOYS HE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH BEGAN TO UNKNOWNWORD HIM . IT BECAME INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD TO GO TO SCHOOL . SO THE UNKNOWNWORD IS ONE OF THE REAL UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD IF WE ARE TO TAKE ON UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD . WE SHOULD TAKE HEART THAT THE UNITED NATIONS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD MILLION TO UNKNOWNWORD MILLION . BUT PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE STILL UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD EVERY DAY . UNKNOWNWORD IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IN AFRICA , WHERE UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN IN THE WORLD LIVE . DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT THE TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD HAS PASSED . WE CAN'T SLOW . WE CAN'T REST . AND WE CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD . I'VE SEEN THE TRAGEDY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . FROM A DEAR FRIEND , WHO TOLD ME IN THE EARLY UNKNOWNWORD - MUCH I MUST UNKNOWNWORD TO MY UNKNOWNWORD IN THOSE DAYS - THAT HE WAS UNKNOWNWORD . HE HAD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND HE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AFTER . TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GIRL THAT I MET IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT A UNKNOWNWORD FOR FORMER UNKNOWNWORD . SHE HAD BEEN UNKNOWNWORD INTO UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF EIGHT BY HER FAMILY FOR A UNKNOWNWORD TELEVISION . SHE WAS PUT TO WORK IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . SHE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS UNKNOWNWORD OUT AND UNKNOWNWORD HOME TO A FAMILY THAT WOULD NOT TAKE HER IN . SHE DID FIND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I MET HER SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR , SO WEAK SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TALK . AS I UNKNOWNWORD DOWN UNKNOWNWORD HER , I COULD SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS HER UNKNOWNWORD . I THOUGHT OF MY OWN DAUGHTER AND OF ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD HER UNKNOWNWORD WHO SPEAK WITH SUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , AND ABOUT HOW CRUEL AN UNKNOWNWORD IT WAS THAT THIS CHILD WOULD NEVER KNOW UNKNOWNWORD . A WEEK AFTER I UNKNOWNWORD TO AMERICA , PEOPLE RUNNING THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ME TO TELL ME SHE HAD UNKNOWNWORD . TO THIS DAY , I THINK OF THAT UNKNOWNWORD FACE AND THOSE WARM EYES AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE TO UNKNOWNWORD HER THE FATE SHE MET . SHE MAY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD , BUT UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT JUST AN UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEM , IT'S NOT JUST AN UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEM , AND IT'S NOT JUST AN AMERICAN PROBLEM . AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMEONE UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEM . IT'S A PROBLEM OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY , AND WE ARE CALLED TO UNKNOWNWORD , WITH LOVE , WITH UNKNOWNWORD , AND WITH URGENCY . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL WAGE THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT IT DEMANDS . I WILL ASK FOR UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD , [APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL ASK FOR MORE MONEY TO TACKLE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL . I WILL BUILD ON THE FUNDING LEVELS IN UNKNOWNWORD AND ON THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE PRESIDENT AND MRS . BUSH HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD IS AN AMERICAN COMMITMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE SEEK UNKNOWNWORD SOLUTIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS . IF WE START ACTING NOT AS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS BUT AS AMERICANS AGAIN . THIS IS ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTNERSHIP . THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNWORD AND FAITH BASED UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND INCREASINGLY IN OTHER UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WORLD WHO ARE UNDERSTANDING THE URGENCY OF THIS MISSION . THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNWORD AND NOT FOR PROFIT UNKNOWNWORD LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR MY HUSBAND'S WORK FOR THE CLINTON UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD WHAT WE ARE DOING THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT , AND THEY ARE DOING WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO . AND IT IS THAT PARTNERSHIP THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN . WHEN I WAS PRIVILEGED TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD , TRAVELING TO MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES , I WAS OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD BY HOW SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA . AS UNKNOWNWORD WAS SAYING , THE PRIVATE , THE PUBLIC , THE UNKNOWNWORD - THERE WAS NO SENSE THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THEIR TIME , GIVE UP THEIR MONEY TO HELP MEET A COMMON NEED . BUT WE ARE SETTING FORTH THAT EXAMPLE , AS WELL , IN THE WORK THAT IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD . BY DOING THIS , WHICH IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO , WE ARE ALSO HELPING TO IMPROVE AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE WORLD . WE ARE PUTTING A DIFFERENT FACE ON OUR COUNTRY ; WE ARE REACHING OUT IN A COMMON UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE WILL BE ABLE NOT ONLY TO BUILD ON THAT WORK , TO SAVE LIVES , TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS UNKNOWNWORD , BUT ALSO TO CREATE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE VALUES AND IDEALS THAT WE HOLD DEAR . IN ORDER TO UNKNOWNWORD MY GOALS AS PRESIDENT I HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OUT A VERY COMPREHENSIVE UNKNOWNWORD AGENDA . FIRST , MY ADMINISTRATION WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD AND CAPACITY BUILDING BY IMPROVING HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS AFRICA AND UNKNOWNWORD THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENT WITH UNKNOWNWORD . FUNDING IN FIVE YEARS . EVERYONE WHO IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THESE DRUGS . I WANT PARTICULARLY TO TARGET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE KNOW HOW TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM MOTHER TO CHILD BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE SYSTEM BEHIND UNKNOWNWORD THE DRUGS THAT ARE NECESSARY . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO MUCH MORE TO ENCOURAGE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD AND THERE HAS TO BE A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT TO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD . SOME COUNTRIES ARE BEGINNING TO DO THIS AND WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM . UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN PREVENTION , TEACHING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HOW TO BE RESPONSIBLE ; HOW BEST TO PROTECT THEMSELVES . I UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TEN YEARS AGO TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM , AND IT UNKNOWNWORD RESULTS . UNKNOWNWORD , BE UNKNOWNWORD , USE UNKNOWNWORD IF NECESSARY . AND THIS HAS TO BE A MESSAGE THAT WE DO MUCH MORE TO UNKNOWNWORD EFFECTIVELY THROUGHOUT AREAS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL CONTINUE TO UNKNOWNWORD IN RESEARCH TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD . THERE WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD , AS WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SEEN , BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN AFFORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . AND FINALLY , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD THE BATTLE AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN AMERICA . BUT I KNOW THAT NEITHER MONEY UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT ALONE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM . UNKNOWNWORD TELLS US THAT THE BODY IS MADE UP OF MANY UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD ALL ITS UNKNOWNWORD ARE MANY , THEY FORM ONE BODY ." WELL WE NEED , AS THOUGH WE WERE ONE BODY , TO USE EVERY UNKNOWNWORD AT OUR HANDS , OUR UNKNOWNWORD . BECAUSE AS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD MUST BE DONE UNKNOWNWORD , BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD AND HERE AT HOME . BECAUSE IF WE FAIL TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD , WE WILL FAIL TO CONQUER UNKNOWNWORD . AS YOU HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , THERE ARE SIX THINGS UNKNOWNWORD CAN DO : CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD AND THEIR FAMILIES . ENCOURAGE UNKNOWNWORD , EVEN BECOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNLEASH VOLUNTEERS . REDUCE THE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD IT'S NOT A UNKNOWNWORD TO BE SICK . CHAMPION HEALTHY UNKNOWNWORD . AND BE TREATMENT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THOSE TAKING UNKNOWNWORD . I WOULD ADD THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALSO MUST UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD SIDE OF THIS CRISIS . BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT JUST A UNKNOWNWORD EMERGENCY . WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ALONE AFTER LOSING BOTH PARENTS TO UNKNOWNWORD ? WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THOUSANDS OF UNKNOWNWORD TO BE UNKNOWNWORD FOR A UNKNOWNWORD TELEVISION OR A FEW DOLLARS INTO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SLAVERY EACH YEAR ? WHO WILL PROVIDE UNKNOWNWORD AND HOPE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD ? WHO WILL WELCOME THE DRUG UNKNOWNWORD USING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ? JUST AS IN MY OWN LIFE I NEED BOTH FAITH AND WORK TO BE WHOLE - UNKNOWNWORD THE WORLD WILL TAKE BOTH FAITH AND WORK AS WELL . WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO . BUT WE CAN ALSO UNKNOWNWORD IT'S SMART , AS WELL . UNKNOWNWORD IS TURNING BACK THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN AFRICA AND UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES AND UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIES . IN SOME PLACES , UNKNOWNWORD CAN BE EVEN MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN WAR . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND DESPAIR , AND WE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF HOPE AND PROGRESS . AND NOTHING WILL HELP AMERICA MORE TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS AROUND THE WORLD MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA'S TRUE HEART ON PROBLEMS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . IN FACT , WE KNOW OUR VALUES ARE THE SOURCE OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD STRENGTH . AS THE PEACE PLAN HAS UNKNOWNWORD SO UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , WE CAN'T ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IS DEEPLY UNKNOWNWORD WITH SO MANY OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD , WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM AS WELL . TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO END UNKNOWNWORD IN AFRICA . UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD THE HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF HEALTH SPENDING IN MANY COUNTRIES - MONEY WE NEED TO FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IS A CHALLENGE TO OUR UNKNOWNWORD IN ITS OWN RIGHT . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THAT MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD EVERY YEAR FROM A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE CHILDREN . A CHILD IN AFRICA UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD EVERY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE MADE A DECISION TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN NORTH AMERICA AND IN EUROPE . AND WE CAN DO THE SAME IN AFRICA AND ASIA . SO I'LL SET A UNKNOWNWORD OF ENDING ALL UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD IN AFRICA BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM . WE CAN DO THIS IF WE ARE COMMITTED TOGETHER . WE ALSO NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD CONFRONT UNKNOWNWORD - A UNKNOWNWORD THAT TAKES THE LIVES OF SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE THEY SHOULD GO . A UNKNOWNWORD THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO BECOME UNKNOWNWORD . THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US . IT MAY START IN AFRICA OR IN A UNKNOWNWORD IN RUSSIA OR IN SOME OTHER FAR AWAY PLACE , BUT IT UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US BECAUSE IN A WORLD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE AND UNKNOWNWORD MOVE FREELY . TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE ALSO NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE WORLD'S CHILDREN . EDUCATION NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD POVERTY AND IMPROVES HEALTH , IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD FORM OF PREVENTION . IT IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD " AGAINST THE SPREAD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BUT TODAY , UNKNOWNWORD MILLION YOUNG CHILDREN - MOST OF THEM UNKNOWNWORD - WILL NOT SET FOOT IN A SCHOOL , AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WILL NOT GO BEYOND PRIMARY SCHOOL . IN FACT , THERE ARE MORE YOUNG CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL IN AFRICA , THAN THERE ARE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL IN AMERICA . EVERY DAY WE DON'T ACT , WE UNKNOWNWORD MORE CHILDREN THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY DESERVE . WE UNKNOWNWORD FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD THE ABILITY TO READ A UNKNOWNWORD TO THEIR CHILDREN OR A UNKNOWNWORD ON A MEDICINE UNKNOWNWORD . WE UNKNOWNWORD WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD : THE POWER TO LEARN , TO UNKNOWNWORD , TO GROW , TO REACH UNKNOWNWORD GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . SO AS PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK TO PASS AND THEN UNKNOWNWORD MY UNKNOWNWORD EDUCATION FOR ALL ACT TO HELP PROVIDE A QUALITY , BASIC EDUCATION FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD AROUND THE WORLD . AND FINALLY , TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS . UNKNOWNWORD TAKES A PARTICULARLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON WOMEN AND UNKNOWNWORD - ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD AFRICA ARE WOMEN . THEY ARE YOUNG UNKNOWNWORD WHO ARE TAKEN IN UNKNOWNWORD OR IN UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE WOMEN WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; WHO HAVE NO SAY IN THEIR OWN LIVES , WHO WORK FROM UNKNOWNWORD UP TO UNKNOWNWORD DOWN ; WHO NEVER BELIEVED THEY HAVE ANY WAY TO SPEAK UP OR BE HEARD . THEIR SOCIETIES AND THEIR COUNTRY DON'T RECOGNIZE THEIR RIGHTS TO HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION . THEY DON'T UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ECONOMY IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAY , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR WORK KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE AND UNKNOWNWORD . I REMEMBER ONCE DRIVING THROUGH AFRICA ON A UNKNOWNWORD WITH A GROUP OF UNKNOWNWORD EXPERTS AND IN FIELD AFTER FIELD AND MARKETPLACE AFTER MARKETPLACE WE SAW WOMEN WORKING , WOMEN WORKING HARD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WATER , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD SAID , UNKNOWNWORD , IT'S TOO BAD THAT ALL OF THEIR WORK DOESN'T MATTER IN THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY ." AND I SAID , WELL , IF THEY STOPPED ALL OF THEIR WORK , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY WOULD COLLAPSE . AND IT IS TIME WE PAY TRIBUTE AND RESPECT TO THE HARD WORK OF SUCH WOMEN . AND IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STAND UP FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS . AS I SAW SO UNKNOWNWORD AT THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD DENIED THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS ARE UNKNOWNWORD AT RISK OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COUNTRY TODAY , WOMEN ARE NOW THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , I WENT TO BEIJING ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY FOR THE UNITED NATION'S UNKNOWNWORD WORLD UNKNOWNWORD ON WOMEN . I SAID WHAT MOST OF US BELIEVE HERE IN AMERICA , THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS , BUT IT WAS UNKNOWNWORD A RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD . I REMEMBER BEING ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD AFTER I CAME BACK . IT WAS A CALL IN UNKNOWNWORD SHOW THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND A UNKNOWNWORD FROM IRAN CALLED AND HE ASKED ME UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DID I MEAN BY SAYING THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS WERE HUMAN RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD AND I SAID , I WANT YOU TO STOP FOR A MINUTE , MAYBE CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK ABOUT ALL THE RIGHTS YOU HAVE AS A MAN . THE RIGHT TO WORK , THE RIGHT TO PURSUE AN EDUCATION , THE RIGHT TO START A BUSINESS , THE RIGHT TO BE UNKNOWNWORD IN YOUR COUNTRY'S UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE ARE THE RIGHTS I'M TALKING ABOUT . THE RIGHTS THAT ARE THE REAL UNKNOWNWORD OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO UNKNOWNWORD WOMEN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD ON EVERYTHING FROM UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH TO UNKNOWNWORD AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP . I'LL CONTINUE THE WORK I STARTED AS FIRST LADY AND NOW AS A SENATOR TO END THE BUYING AND UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND WOMEN INTO UNKNOWNWORD SLAVERY . NOW , I KNOW THIS WON'T BE EASY . BUT I ALSO KNOW THE POWER OF AMERICA AT OUR BEST , AND I KNOW THE POWER OF FAITH AND OF PEOPLE OF FAITH , WHEN WE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CALL TO LIFT UP OUR VOICES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD . THE FAITH COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD UP ITS UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST SLAVERY AND HELPED LEAD AMERICA TO END THAT EVIL . THE FAITH COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN AMERICA AND AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HELPED END BOTH . THE FAITH COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD FOR DEBT RELIEF FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES , AND GAVE MANY COUNTRIES A UNKNOWNWORD START IN THE UNKNOWNWORD YEAR . TODAY THE FAITH COMMUNITY IS UNKNOWNWORD OUT AGAINST GENOCIDE IN DARFUR . TAKING ON GLOBAL WARMING AND WE CAN SEE FROM THIS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER TO ADDRESS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . TOGETHER I BELIEVE , WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY . IT IS A PROUD AND UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY . THANK YOU , THANK YOU TO UNKNOWNWORD . THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR THE WORK YOU ARE DOING AND FOR LIVING YOUR FAITH IN SUCH A VISIBLE WAY . AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD MY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND GOD UNKNOWNWORD . 
BLUE	I'M UNKNOWNWORD TO BE HERE . I UNKNOWNWORD FOR BEING A LITTLE LATE . UNKNOWNWORD , THERE WAS MORE OF A UNKNOWNWORD THAN UNKNOWNWORD AND IT TOOK US A LOT LONGER AND I UNKNOWNWORD FOR THAT . AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND BEING PART OF THIS EVENT TODAY . I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A FEW PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M SO PLEASED THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS EVENT HERE AT THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD CITY FOR UNKNOWNWORD US TODAY . AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FORMER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO'S HERE . I WANT TO ALSO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE HEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN IOWA ... I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD , THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE DEMOCRATIC UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD COUNTY . ALSO I WANT TO THANK OUR UNKNOWNWORD UP ON THE UNKNOWNWORD HERE WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM IN A MINUTE . IN ADDITION TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE FORMER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL HERE IN IOWA , UNKNOWNWORD HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD I'M GOING TO BE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT IN A MINUTE , AS DO OUR TWO OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . ONE IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHOSE DAUGHTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ASKED ME A QUESTION LAST WEEK WHEN I WAS HERE IN IOWA AND IT UNKNOWNWORD OUT THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD AND ASKED ME AN UNKNOWNWORD QUESTION AND IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE DEALING WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND ALL OF THEIR CHALLENGES . AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO IS ONE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CARE UNKNOWNWORD AND CARE UNKNOWNWORD IS WITH US NOW . NOW I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OVER THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE SO POWERFUL ON THEIR EYES AND THAT'S NOT GOOD , IS IT ? SO MAYBE IF SOMEBODY COULD HEAR MY UNKNOWNWORD AND WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE LIGHTS ... I'M UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THAT , BUT THAT'S MOTHER UNKNOWNWORD AND WE'LL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT . UNKNOWNWORD , TODAY WE ARE HERE AT THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY HERE IN UNKNOWNWORD CITY . AND ONE OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WHICH THEY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH UNKNOWNWORD . SO THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN UNKNOWNWORD THOSE SERVICES . NOW UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN A STRONG LEADER AND UNKNOWNWORD ON BEHALF OF FAMILIES WITH UNKNOWNWORD FOR YEARS . AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SHE LED THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES , AND SHE HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES . HER WORK WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD ADULTS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD , IS AN EXAMPLE THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE COUNTRY . SHE CAME TO THIS AS MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD DO , BECAUSE OF HER OWN CHILD . AND TO THE UNKNOWNWORD WE'RE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TODAY AS PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN , IT'S BECAUSE OF PARENTS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD WHO FOUGHT FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVEN UNKNOWNWORD THERE WAS A PROBLEM . UNKNOWNWORD BY THEIR LOVE AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE RAISED UNKNOWNWORD , DEMANDED FUNDING , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR EYES TO THE NEEDS OF SO MANY CHILDREN . NOW , WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL , I TOOK A UNKNOWNWORD YEAR AT THE UNKNOWNWORD CHILD UNKNOWNWORD CENTER . THAT WAS BACK IN THE VERY EARLY 1970'S . AT THAT TIME , SCIENCE WAS STILL UNKNOWNWORD PARENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD . AND THEY PARTICULARLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND I REMEMBER UNKNOWNWORD SOME OF THE UNKNOWNWORD RESEARCH AND IN PARTICULAR THE WORK OF ONE UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAD A LOT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS UNKNOWNWORD . AND I THOUGHT , YOU KNOW , THAT JUST CAN'T BE RIGHT , THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO IT TO THAT . I LATER MOVED TO LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD WHERE ONE OF MY FRIEND HAD A SON WITH UNKNOWNWORD . AND I SPENT TIME IN HER HOME , I SPENT TIME WITH HER AND HER SON AND MY UNKNOWNWORD PERHAPS AS A MOTHER WAS THAT THIS COULD NOT BE THE UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , DESPITE WHAT SCIENCE USED TO DO , UNKNOWNWORD THE PARENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD KIDS , NOW WE KNOW THAT PARENTS ARE THE CHILD'S BEST HOPE TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS A VERY UNKNOWNWORD SET OF CONDITIONS . I WANTED TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS ISSUE TODAY BECAUSE THE UNKNOWNWORD INCREASES IN UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD . THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DISORDER , THAT MEANS ACROSS THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM WHAT'S CALLED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE KIDS WITH IT MAY BE OR ADULTS WITH IT MAY BE NOT AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS YOU OR I WOULD BE BUT THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD PRETTY WELL , ALL THE WAY TO THE MOST SEVERE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD INCLUDING UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - ALL UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD AND DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD THAT PEOPLE HAVE . THE NUMBER WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DISORDER HAS UNKNOWNWORD FROM 1 IN 10,000 IN 1993 TO 1 IN UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD CONTINUE TO RISE . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY BELIEVE THAT COULD REACH FOUR MILLION IN THE NEXT DECADE . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE OF ALL UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD IT IS FOUR TIMES MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD BOYS THAN UNKNOWNWORD WHICH IS WHY THE BOYS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THIS HERE IN UNKNOWNWORD CITY IS SUCH A GREAT UNKNOWNWORD . AND UNKNOWNWORD IS COSTING THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST 35 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR . THE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE BECOME ALL TOO UNKNOWNWORD . THE CHILD WHO NEVER MAKES UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , DOESN'T NOTICE WHEN HIS DAD COMES HOME AFTER WORK . THE CHILD WHO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN . THE CHILD WHO WOULD RATHER UNKNOWNWORD IN A CORNER BY UNKNOWNWORD THAN UNKNOWNWORD WITH OTHER KIDS . THESE CHILDREN HAVE SO MUCH TO UNKNOWNWORD , BUT THEY ARE OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD INSIDE THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . YET FOR ALL THE PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT UNKNOWNWORD IT AND WHY IT IS UNKNOWNWORD IN NUMBER . WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO UNKNOWNWORD IT AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BEST WAYS TO UNKNOWNWORD IT . WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SERVICES TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT OR SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES . I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A GOVERNMENT AND A PRESIDENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE SERIOUSNESS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND ADDRESSED IT UNKNOWNWORD . I AM COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE , AND AS UNKNOWNWORD SAID I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN , PARTICULARLY CHILDREN WITH NEEDS , CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES , CHILDREN WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD , CHILDREN WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE FOR MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE . ONCE I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND , MY FIRST UNKNOWNWORD WAS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGURE OUT WHY SO MANY CHILDREN WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD FIGURES WEREN'T UNKNOWNWORD IN SCHOOL . I WENT DOOR TO DOOR , AND HOME AFTER HOME , I FOUND REASON ; I FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND OR WHO WERE DEAF ; CHILDREN IN UNKNOWNWORD ; CHILDREN WITH UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS . THEY WERE KEPT HOME BECAUSE SCHOOLS WOULDN'T UNKNOWNWORD THEM . I KNEW THEN THAT I WANTED TO SPEND MY LIFE BEING A UNKNOWNWORD FOR CHILDREN - CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TOO OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD . I WANTED TO FIGHT TO GIVE ALL CHILDREN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES I HAD GROWING UP . TODAY , ONE OF THE MOST URGENT - AND LEAST UNDERSTOOD - CHALLENGES FACING OUR CHILDREN IS THIS RISING UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY AS FIRST LADY , I FOUGHT HARD FOR MORE UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE FUNDING FOR UNKNOWNWORD . I WAS VERY PROUD WHEN MY HUSBAND UNKNOWNWORD THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH HAD A UNKNOWNWORD FOCUS ON UNKNOWNWORD RESEARCH AND UNKNOWNWORD A LONG-TERM UNKNOWNWORD ON ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH . IN THE SENATE , I HELPED DEVELOP AND UNKNOWNWORD THE COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD ACT OF 2006 , WHICH WAS UNKNOWNWORD INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT BUSH . THE BILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , EARLY UNKNOWNWORD AND EARLY INTERVENTION . AND IN UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS YEAR , I UNKNOWNWORD THE EXPANDING THE PROMISE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH UNKNOWNWORD ACT UNKNOWNWORD WITH MY UNKNOWNWORD , SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD . THIS UNKNOWNWORD ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SERVICES THAT WILL CROSS THE LIFE UNKNOWNWORD . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL BUILD ON MY WORK WITH A STRONG COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL START , FIRST , BY INVESTING UNKNOWNWORD IN RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TO START UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO HELP FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD , BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH UNKNOWNWORD THE BILL BUT REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING , A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND HE JUST VETOED A BILL THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED FUNDING FOR UNKNOWNWORD IN . UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO FUND RESEARCH TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , INCLUDING POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD . THAT UNKNOWNWORD EXPANDING OUR SYSTEM FOR HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD , SO THAT WE CAN LOOK FOR UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RISE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SINCE 2001 . I'VE UNKNOWNWORD AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD BILL EVERY CONGRESS SINCE THEN BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THREE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT PEOPLE : UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND ENVIRONMENT AND UNKNOWNWORD IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE OR MORE OF THOSE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE UNKNOWNWORD DONE ENOUGH TO REALLY FIGURE OUT TO WHAT IT IS WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN TO FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD , PERHAPS , A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THAT MAKES PEOPLE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD SHOW THAT . UNKNOWNWORD IT'S DIAGNOSED AROUND 18 MONTHS , IF YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE CONDITIONS . LOTS OF TIMES IT DOESN'T UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL THE CHILD IS 4 OR UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT MEANS THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE TREATMENT AND INTERVENTION THAT COULD HELP . I'LL ALSO CREATE AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FORCE UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SERVICES . I'M UNKNOWNWORD THIS AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN BREAST CANCER . BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BECAME UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND SCIENTISTS AND UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT CAUSED BREAST CANCER AND WHAT THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD WERE . ONCE THE UNKNOWNWORD FORCE HAS DONE ITS WORK , I'LL ACT ON ITS UNKNOWNWORD . MORE RESEARCH IS OUR BEST HOPE FOR COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD , AND , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL FUND IT . FOR THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE THROUGHOUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD TO PROVIDE CARE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD . THIS STARTS WITH BETTER UNKNOWNWORD . THE AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CALLED FOR A UNIVERSAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR ALL CHILDREN UNDER THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , I APPLAUD THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD TO LEARN ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND BEGIN TO UNKNOWNWORD INFORMATION SO THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD IT UNKNOWNWORD . TO UNKNOWNWORD THOSE EFFORTS , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE GET UNKNOWNWORD INFORMATION TO PROFESSIONALS WHO DEAL WITH YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH FEDERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS HEAD START , UNKNOWNWORD AND CHIP . NEXT , I'LL EXPAND ACCESS TO UNKNOWNWORD CARE SO THAT WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO TREATMENT . TODAY , THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNKNOWNWORD IS GROWING FAR UNKNOWNWORD THAN THE CARE UNKNOWNWORD . THAT MEANS PARENTS OFTEN HAVE TO HEAR A UNKNOWNWORD SAY : UNKNOWNWORD CHILD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ," AND THEN GET SENT AWAY WITH NO GOOD UNKNOWNWORD FOR CARE . THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRAGIC BECAUSE WE KNOW EARLY INTERVENTION CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE . AS UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN REACH UNKNOWNWORD , WE'LL SUPPORT THEM IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEREVER POSSIBLE . THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE . BUT THE TRAINING FOR TEACHERS HASN'T ; IN FACT , A LOT OF TEACHERS GET NO TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR UNKNOWNWORD TRAINING SO THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD THEIR MISSION OF TEACHING EVERY CHILD . AND WE WON'T STOP CARING ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD INDIVIDUALS JUST BECAUSE THEY GROW UP . WITH ACCESS TO THE RIGHT UNKNOWNWORD OF SERVICES , INCLUDING UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE CAN HELP ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD LIVE RICH AND FULL LIVES . SO I WILL HELP STATES CREATE AND PROVIDE UNKNOWNWORD SERVICES FOR ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD . FOR PARENTS , WE'LL CREATE AN UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CENTER TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SERVICES . AND FINALLY , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL FUND QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN . MY AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN UNKNOWNWORD YOU KEEP YOUR EXISTING COVERAGE IF YOU LIKE IT , BUT IT UNKNOWNWORD AFFORDABLE CHOICES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM , AND IT COVERS EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN . WHAT UNKNOWNWORD IN FAMILIES OF UNKNOWNWORD , OR FAMILIES WITH DIABETES OR FAMILIES WITH A HISTORY OF CANCER OR HEART UNKNOWNWORD OR ANY OTHER CONDITION , IS THAT UNKNOWNWORD INSURANCE IS SO EXPENSIVE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT , WHEN THE INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER THE VERY THING YOU NEED IT FOR . EVERYONE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CHOICES MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE . I ALWAYS SAY , IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES . UNDER MY PLAN , YOU AND YOUR CHILD WILL NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF UNKNOWNWORD CONDITIONS OR RISK UNKNOWNWORD . PARENTS WILL NO LONGER BE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JUST BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN HAVE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN ALL AMERICANS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTHCARE , WE'LL BE ABLE TO REACH SO MANY MORE CHILDREN EARLY ON . MY HEALTH PLAN , MY UNKNOWNWORD AGENDA , AND ALL OF THE POLICIES THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD ARE UNITED BY MY UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT'S UP TO US TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN , AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT EVERY CHILD HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . WE HAVE LEARNED THAT CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL INDEED . THESE ARE NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD NEEDS INDIVIDUALS , THESE ARE UNKNOWNWORD INDIVIDUALS . THEY HAVE A LOT TO OFFER . JUST LAST WEEK , AT AN EVENT IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , A YOUNG WOMAN WITH UNKNOWNWORD - I HAD NO IDEA , I WAS JUST LOOKING OUT AT A CROWD LIKE THIS , AND SHE WAS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HER HAND WITH THAT BIG UNKNOWNWORD ON HER FACE , ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD AND PROBLEM OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND SHE SAID LATER , SHE IS UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD ." NOW , I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR WORLD , AND I AM SO PLEASED TO BE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD MOM - UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - AND HER UNKNOWNWORD - DR . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - TODAY . UNKNOWNWORD NOT ALONE . SO WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON ANY CHILD ; I THINK THAT IS ONE OF OUR OBLIGATIONS . AND TOGETHER , WE CAN HELP ALL THOSE LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD TO LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL . AND WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD OURSELVES TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS REALLY DIFFICULT AND VERY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD CONDITION THAT UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN , LITERALLY OUT OF THE BLUE . THERE IS NO UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT , WE DON'T KNOW IT'S COMING , AND UNKNOWNWORD THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS HAPPENING UNTIL THE UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD . SO , NOW I WANT TO TURN TO THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED WITH IT , WHO CAN ADD TO WHAT I SAID BEFORE WE TURN TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS ON ANY ISSUE THAT'S ON YOUR MINDS . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH . 
BLUE	THANK YOU . UNKNOWNWORD , MY GOODNESS , THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . UNKNOWNWORD , THANK YOU . THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL . AND THOSE OF YOU FROM UNKNOWNWORD KNOW UNKNOWNWORD DUFFY AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE INSPIRATION FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT THE HIGH SCHOOL . AND I ASKED HER HOW LONG UNKNOWNWORD BEEN TEACHING , AND SHE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD YEARS ." AND LET'S GIVE HER A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR HER UNKNOWNWORD TO EDUCATION . THANK YOU , UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] I ALSO WANT TO THANK DR . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD COMMUNITY SCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD , FOR BEING HERE . THANK YOU SO MUCH , DR . UNKNOWNWORD . AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD COUNTY UNKNOWNWORD AND ONE OF MY UNKNOWNWORD CAPTAINS , I THANK HIM FOR COMING . I ALSO WANT TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO IS THE POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD COUNCIL UNKNOWNWORD . AND THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE I WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE FIELD UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD COUNTIES . WHERE IS UNKNOWNWORD ? IF SHE CAN UNKNOWNWORD OR -- THERE SHE IS BACK THERE . THANK YOU SO MUCH . AND SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS VERY , VERY DEAR TO ME , WHO HAS SERVED IOWA FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT CHAMPION OF EDUCATION AND UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THANK YOU SO MUCH , UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , I'LL BE ALL OVER THE STATE TODAY AND TOMORROW , AND THEN I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO GIVE YOU A BREAK FOR UNKNOWNWORD . DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ? SO EVERYBODY CAN UNKNOWNWORD WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY . THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE DOING ; GOING BACK HOME AND WORKING WITH MY DAUGHTER TO CREATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE TO DO EVERY YEAR . THEN WE'LL BE BACK OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD , TRAVELING THE STATE , MEETING AS MANY IOWANS AS I POSSIBLY CAN . BUT TODAY I WANTED TO COME TO UNKNOWNWORD TO REALLY UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT OUR ECONOMY . I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A FEW UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY , BECAUSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL UNKNOWNWORD , UNFORTUNATELY , A LOT OF PROBLEMS . NOW , THIS IS KIND OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR ME , BECAUSE WHEN MY HUSBAND BECAME PRESIDENT HE INHERITED A LOT OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS . AS SOMEONE SAID THE OTHER DAY , THERE SEEMS TO BE A UNKNOWNWORD HERE : IT TAKES A CLINTON TO CLEAN UP AFTER A BUSH . AND SO ... [APPLAUSE ] AND SO I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME TELLING YOU HOW I SEE THIS PROBLEM AND TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO TO ADDRESS IT , BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NOT HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE . YOU KNOW , WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMY THAT IS INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD EACH DAY , NOT JUST BY THE BILLIONS OF DECISIONS THAT UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS MAKE , BUT BY BILLIONS MORE THAT ARE MADE AROUND THE WORLD . AND SOMETHING THAT NOW UNKNOWNWORD FAR AWAY FROM IOWA CAN HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD EFFECT THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF LIVING FOR AMERICANS . OUR ECONOMY IN UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS HAS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE'VE GOT RISING OIL UNKNOWNWORD ; WE'VE GOT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS ; WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IN TERMS OF ITS UNKNOWNWORD ; WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL DEBT ; AND WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CONFIDENCE . JUST UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THAT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY ARE UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SINCE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD STARTED ASKING THE QUESTION BACK IN UNKNOWNWORD . AND IN UNKNOWNWORD , IT WAS THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT HAD BEEN IN UNKNOWNWORD YEARS . SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT REAL PROBLEMS , BUT WE SEE NOTHING HAPPENING UNDER THIS PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS . UNFORTUNATELY , THE PRESIDENT EITHER DOESN'T SEE THEM OR UNKNOWNWORD TO DEAL WITH THEM . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD EFFECT OF IT ALL IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES . NOW , WE ALL HOPE THAT THE ECONOMY WILL UNKNOWNWORD RESILIENT , AND WE KNOW THAT , IF WE MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CAN , ONCE AGAIN , CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND LIFT UP THE MIDDLE CLASS . BUT INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD POLICIES UNKNOWNWORD AT MAKING THAT UNKNOWNWORD , WE'VE HAD THE UNKNOWNWORD : UNKNOWNWORD FISCAL POLICIES AND A PRESIDENT WITH A TRAGIC UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS UNTIL THEY BECOME UNKNOWNWORD . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY AT A TIME WHEN THE BILLS FROM EIGHT YEARS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD WILL BE COMING UNKNOWNWORD . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO TURN AROUND OUR NATION AND OUR ECONOMY . MORE THAN EVER BEFORE , WORKERS WILL NEED GOOD JOB TRAINING FOR THE JOBS OF THIS NEW CENTURY , BUT THERE IS ONE JOB WE CAN'T AFFORD ON - UNKNOWNWORD TRAINING FOR : THAT IS THE JOB OF OUR NEXT PRESIDENT . THAT COULD BE THE UNKNOWNWORD JOB TRAINING IN HISTORY . EVERY DAY SPENT LEARNING THE UNKNOWNWORD IS ANOTHER DAY OF RISING COSTS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND GROWING UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR FAMILIES . AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP WAITING . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND HAS THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO ADDRESS THEM FROM DAY ONE , A PRESIDENT WHO HAS FAITH THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY ARE UP TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF YOU GIVE ME THAT CHANCE , I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF YOU . [APPLAUSE ] IN UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS , WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . FIRST , WE HAVE A GROWING CRISIS IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD MARKET THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD OUR FAMILIES AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL MARKETS . OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , MANY FAMILIES WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO RISKY UNKNOWNWORD TO FINANCE THEIR HOMES , WITH RATES THAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD . AND UNKNOWNWORD DID LITTLE TO UNKNOWNWORD DOWN ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD SO FAR THIS YEAR , NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD IN IOWA ALONE THIS PAST THREE MONTHS . THAT IS ALMOST DOUBLE THE FIGURE FROM LAST YEAR . AND HOME UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS AMERICA ARE UNKNOWNWORD . AND UNFORTUNATELY , A LOT OF EXPERTS UNKNOWNWORD THEY WILL DROP EVEN FURTHER . THAT'S SERIOUS NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT , BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH OF UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES IS IN THEIR HOME UNKNOWNWORD . AND HOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS . SO AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE HAVE LESS MONEY TO DRAW ON FOR EVERYTHING FROM UNKNOWNWORD BILLS TO COLLEGE UNKNOWNWORD . TO MAKE UNKNOWNWORD WORSE , ALL OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL MARKETS . UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ENORMOUS UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THEY'VE UNKNOWNWORD DOWN MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD ARE INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD , COMPANIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO RAISE THE CAPITAL THEY NEED TO EXPAND , AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD TO PROVIDE UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD TO FAMILIES . SECOND , UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND RISING COSTS . YOU KNOW , AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH , WE HAD A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO CALL AMERICANS , TO CALL ALL OF US TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . INSTEAD , WE OUTSOURCED OUR ENERGY POLICY TO UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY AND THE OIL COMPANIES . AND TODAY WE ARE EVEN MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL THAN WE WERE ON SEPTEMBER THE 11TH . OIL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR . UNKNOWNWORD ARE MOVING UP . IT'S NOW NEARLY $100 A BARREL . GAS HIT UNKNOWNWORD PER UNKNOWNWORD NATIONWIDE , THE HIGHEST UNKNOWNWORD EVER FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR . AS A UNKNOWNWORD , AVERAGE FAMILIES ARE SPENDING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MORE A YEAR ON ENERGY COSTS , FOR ELECTRICITY , HOME UNKNOWNWORD , AND GAS . THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE . IT'S LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY TAX IN JUST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS , MORE THAN THREE TIMES WHAT THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILY UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE BUSH TAX CUTS . I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS . WE'VE BEEN BLESSED ; THE WEATHER HAS NOT YET GOTTEN COLD . SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IF WE DO HAVE A COLD UNKNOWNWORD , YOU KNOW WHAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD : SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PAY THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , WHILE CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD ARE REACHING NEW UNKNOWNWORD , OUR LABOR MARKET IS JUST NOT WORKING FOR UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES . THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . BUT DO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT ? IT'S BECAUSE MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK . WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST DROP OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE . IF YOU UNKNOWNWORD WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH WHERE WE WERE WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK OFFICE , IF YOU HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING AND UNKNOWNWORD LOOKING FOR JOBS , THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , ARE AT A UNKNOWNWORD HIGH . SO HERE WE CONTRAST VERY HIGH CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . AND OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT JUST UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE SLOW GROWTH IN UNKNOWNWORD ACTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD FOR MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD OF THE INCREASE IN CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? WELL , THE UNKNOWNWORD GO UP , BUT UNKNOWNWORD EVERY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY , THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE BOARDS OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT SHARING THE WEALTH . SO COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD OFF OF KEEPING WORKERS ' UNKNOWNWORD STAGNANT . AND AMERICAN WORKERS ? WE'RE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER . WE'RE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD . SO EVEN THOUGH AMERICAN WORKERS ARE UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , THEIR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN THE RICH AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS ONLY GOTTEN UNKNOWNWORD . IN 2005 , THE LAST YEAR I COULD FIND THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR , ALL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WENT TO THE TOP 10 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS , WHILE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT SAW THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP IN ; THAT IS NOT THE COUNTRY THAT I BELIEVE IS UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE PROMISE OF PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY . THE UNKNOWNWORD 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HELD 22 PERCENT OF AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S AN UNKNOWNWORD FIGURE , AND IT IS THE HIGHEST UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD INEQUALITY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , SEVEN YEARS OF FISCAL UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD UP OUR DEBT , UNKNOWNWORD CONFIDENCE IN OUR ECONOMY , AND LEFT US UNKNOWNWORD TO FOREIGN UNKNOWNWORD . SINCE PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK OFFICE , WE'VE SEEN THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR NATION'S FINANCIAL HEALTH IN HISTORY . UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY , UNKNOWNWORD SPENDING THAT WASN'T PAID FOR HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UP OUR NATIONAL DEBT TO UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . THINK ABOUT THAT . WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT , HE INHERITED A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND A UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . NOW WE'RE BACK INTO UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION DEBT . THAT FORCES US EVERY DAY TO UNKNOWNWORD MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA . SO WHEN PEOPLE ACROSS IOWA ASK ME WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA AND OTHER TRADING UNKNOWNWORD , I TELL THEM BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOW OUR UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . HOW CAN WE UNKNOWNWORD ENFORCE TRADE UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WHEN WE HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD MONEY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE MASSIVE DEBT THAT GEORGE BUSH HAS UNKNOWNWORD UP ? AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STANDING IN THE WORLD HAS UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS NOW LESS UNKNOWNWORD THAN OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , SOMETHING ELSE THAT UNKNOWNWORD A LOT OF UNKNOWNWORD , IF YOU LOOK OUT AND SEE WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN IN YEARS TO COME . FINALLY , WE FACE NEW THREATS THAT NEITHER THE PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR ADDRESSED . TAKE THE RISK OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT WALL STREET IS UNKNOWNWORD . THESE PRODUCTS OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD . FOR EXAMPLE , A UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN IOWA WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF CORN COULD BUY A UNKNOWNWORD THAT INCREASES IN UNKNOWNWORD WHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF CORN FALLS , SO UNKNOWNWORD OF WHAT UNKNOWNWORD WITH HIS UNKNOWNWORD , HE HAS A CHANCE TO BREAK EVEN . BUT UNKNOWNWORD ALSO CREATE NEW UNKNOWNWORD . THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . IT ISN'T ALWAYS CLEAR WHO UNKNOWNWORD THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY ARE REALLY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS WHY EVEN THE INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD THAT CREATED THEM ARE LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THESE UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD ARE BEING FELT FROM WALL STREET TO UNKNOWNWORD STREET . I BELIEVE IN OUR MARKETS , BUT MARKETS WORK BEST WHEN THERE IS INFORMATION FLOW . AND A LOT OF THESE NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE NOT UNKNOWNWORD . THE MARKET DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THEM , AND CERTAINLY UNKNOWNWORD DON'T . TODAY , WE NEED A SENSIBLE MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD REGULATION AND A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO A RISK THAT CAN HURT THE INNOCENT , AS WELL AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . ANOTHER NEW CHALLENGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD IS THE GROWTH OF UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , WHAT ARE THESE ? THESE ARE INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS . THEY'RE NOT BUSINESSES . A GOVERNMENT OF A BIG UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD A FUND OF MONEY , PUTS A NAME ON IT , CALLING IT AN INVESTMENT FUND , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OUT OF THIS FUND . THEY'RE USING THESE UNKNOWNWORD TO BUY UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD , REAL UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , WHERE EXACTLY ARE COUNTRIES GETTING THE MONEY FOR THESE UNKNOWNWORD ? THEY'RE GETTING IT FROM US . OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL MEANS WE SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . OUR TRADE UNKNOWNWORD AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD DEBTS MEAN WE SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UNKNOWNWORD TO COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA . THESE COUNTRIES THEN TURN AROUND AND USE OUR DOLLARS TO BUY UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY . TODAY , UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD HOLD AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . WITHIN A DECADE , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HOLD FIVE TIMES THAT MUCH . WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS , AND YOU DON'T HEAR A UNKNOWNWORD OUT OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION . NOW , WHY EXACTLY ARE THESE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD CAUSE FOR CONCERN ? WELL , LET ME ASK YOU THIS : HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT USED ITS UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH FUND TO BUY AN AMERICAN CAR COMPANY AND MOVED IT OVERSEAS ? RIGHT NOW , THAT GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE OUR UNKNOWNWORD , BUT WHAT IF THEY BECAME OUR UNKNOWNWORD , AS WELL ? AND HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF COUNTRIES USED THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA TO INFLUENCE OUR FOREIGN POLICY ? WHAT IF A COUNTRY SET OUT TO BUY COMPANIES THAT COMPETE WITH THEIR NATIONAL INDUSTRIES AND SHUT THEM DOWN ? I DON'T THINK UNKNOWNWORD BE UNKNOWNWORD WITH OUR OWN GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD IN REAL UNKNOWNWORD OR BUYING UP COMPANIES , AND WE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE IDEA OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DOING THESE THINGS IN OUR COUNTRY . IN UNKNOWNWORD , THESE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A POTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY IF WE DON'T ACT NOW TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY . SO TODAY WE FACE AN UNKNOWNWORD OF SERIOUS AND GROWING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT CALL FOR A PRESIDENT WILLING TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD PRIORITY , WILLING TO CONFRONT UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS AND UNKNOWNWORD COMPREHENSIVE UNKNOWNWORD , A PRESIDENT WHO ALWAYS PUTS THE MIDDLE CLASS FIRST . BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS , WE'VE HAD JUST THE UNKNOWNWORD . IN FACT , WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO'S UNKNOWNWORD THE ECONOMY WITH JUST ONE SIMPLE PRINCIPLE IN MIND : TAKE CARE OF THOSE AT THE TOP AND LET MIDDLE - CLASS FAMILIES UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEMSELVES . HE CALLS IT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IT'S REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD ON YOUR OWN ." AND WHAT DO WE GET FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WHEN THE FACT IS THAT UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES ' UNKNOWNWORD HAS DROPPED UNKNOWNWORD ? A CALL TO CUT TAXES AGAIN FOR AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AS OUR TRADE UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD AND WE'VE LOST AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MILLION JOBS TO CHINA , WHAT WAS PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ? HE THREATENED TO VETO TRADE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR DISPLACED WORKERS . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LAST YEAR , WHAT WAS PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ? NOTHING . WHEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD WERE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD , NOTHING . BUT WHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS STARTED TO THREATEN LARGE WALL STREET INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD INTO ACTION . IT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD CALLS WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF MAJOR WALL STREET FIRMS , UNKNOWNWORD TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD THEY COULD . WHAT WAS PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD ANSWER TO SENIORS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO UNKNOWNWORD ? UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY . WHAT ABOUT RISING OIL UNKNOWNWORD ? VETO FUNDING TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES PAY THEIR ENERGY BILLS . UNKNOWNWORD MILLION CHILDREN WITHOUT HEALTH CARE ? VETO HEALTH CARE FOR UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN . HIS ANSWER TO UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE STANDING ON A UNKNOWNWORD DOOR , JUST ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AWAY FROM UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH AND LOSING EVERYTHING ? TAX CUT AFTER TAX CUT FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICANS . NOW , IT'S NO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD TO STAND BY HIS FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES . THIS IS , AFTER ALL , A MAN WHO BELIEVES THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS A UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , IS THAT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THESE FAILED POLICIES . IN FACT , WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO THE ECONOMY IN FOUR SIMPLE WORDS : MORE OF THE SAME . THEY SEE UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION IN DEBT AND SAY , "WHY NOT UNKNOWNWORD MORE ?" THEY SEE TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY AMERICANS AND BIG UNKNOWNWORD AND SAY , "WHY NOT MORE ?" THEY SEE ONE ATTEMPT TO UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY AND SAY , "WHY NOT ONE MORE ?" IN UNKNOWNWORD , THEY SEE EIGHT YEARS OF BUSH UNKNOWNWORD AND SAY , "WHY NOT EIGHT MORE ?" WELL , HERE'S MY UNKNOWNWORD TO THAT : UNKNOWNWORD GOT UNTIL JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD . AND NOT ONE DAY MORE WILL WE PUT UP WITH THESE FAILED POLICIES . [APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD TO GET ON A UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AS WE MAKE THE CASE FOR CHANGE AND THEY ARGUE FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . TO THEM , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD NO BUSH ECONOMIC POLICY BEHIND ." BUT TODAY , AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE , BUT CHANGE IS JUST A UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S EASY TO GIVE A UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THE MIDDLE CLASS , BUT IT IS HARD TO ACTUALLY DO IT . IT'S EASY TO MAKE UP A PROGRAM THAT UNKNOWNWORD EVERY ECONOMIC PROBLEM , BUT IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT . WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO LEAVES THE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON ELECTION DAY . THIS TIME , UNKNOWNWORD , WE WON'T JUST HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD HE MADE . WE'LL ALSO HAVE TO END THE WAR HE STARTED AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS HE LEFT BEHIND . [APPLAUSE ] SO WE DON'T NEED MORE REPUBLICAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT A SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS . AND WE DON'T NEED A UNKNOWNWORD TAX INCREASE THAT WILL HIT FAMILIES ALREADY FACING HIGHER ENERGY , HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE COSTS . WHAT WE NEED IS TO FOCUS ON THE REAL UNKNOWNWORD OF HEALTH CARE AND MEDICARE AND ON EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR POOR , WORKING AND MIDDLE - CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD NOW . IF THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC CHALLENGES UNKNOWNWORD ALL AT ONCE IN A UNKNOWNWORD STORM , THESE FAMILIES , AMERICA'S FAMILIES , WILL BE THE HARDEST HIT . SO , IN UNKNOWNWORD , PRESIDENT BUSH HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE MIDDLE CLASS , UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FIELD AGAINST THEM , AND SAID , UNKNOWNWORD ON YOUR OWN ." REPUBLICANS RUNNING TO UNKNOWNWORD HIM SAY , UNKNOWNWORD TIME FOR MORE OF THE SAME ." AND I SAY WE NEED A NEW UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAD AN ECONOMIC STRATEGY THAT WORKED IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . WE BELIEVED THAT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY COULD UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC GROWTH , SO WE UNKNOWNWORD THE FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD . WE SAW RECORD UNKNOWNWORD , 22 MILLION NEW JOBS , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICAN HISTORY . WE BELIEVE THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR PEOPLE WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR ECONOMY , SO WE UNKNOWNWORD THE EARNED UNKNOWNWORD TAX CREDIT , UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH INSURANCE TO SIX MILLION UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN , UNKNOWNWORD IN HEAD START AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE SAW HISTORIC UNKNOWNWORD IN CHILD POVERTY , FAMILY UNKNOWNWORD UP ON AVERAGE MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD , AND MANY AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE MIDDLE CLASS . SO TODAY WE FACE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGES , SOME OF WHICH WE COULD HAVE NEVER UNKNOWNWORD BACK IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I BELIEVE THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNKNOWNWORD US THEN ARE STILL UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE UNKNOWNWORD AT THE START OF MY PLAN TO HELP RESTORE OUR ECONOMY . I BELIEVE IN AN OPTIMISTIC , UNKNOWNWORD , MODERN UNKNOWNWORD TO THE ECONOMY . THERE'S NO UNKNOWNWORD TO WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT . AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BEGIN ON DAY ONE TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND . I HAVE FOUR UNKNOWNWORD : UNKNOWNWORD NEW JOBS , GOOD JOBS , UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD PROSPERITY ; UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR ECONOMY ; UNKNOWNWORD THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT IF YOU WORK HARD YOU CAN GET HEAD ; AND PUTTING OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER AGAIN . WE'RE GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO UNKNOWNWORD , BUT I AM NOT GOING TO ASK THE MIDDLE CLASS TO DO MORE THAN IT HAS ALREADY DONE . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A MAJOR UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE TAX SUBSIDIES FROM THE OIL COMPANIES , AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE TO WORK ON BEHALF OF CLEAN , RENEWABLE , ALTERNATIVE ENERGY . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO FORCE THE UNKNOWNWORD COMPANIES TO COMPETE . WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD WITH MEDICARE TO GET THOSE DRUG UNKNOWNWORD DOWN . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO TELL THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO HAVE DENIED SO MANY PEOPLE COVERAGE THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST THE SICK , AND WE'RE GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN FOR QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE . WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT ANY UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT TO UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY . WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SOCIAL SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR GENERATIONS . AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR UNKNOWNWORD WITH NEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] AND WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REAL , UNKNOWNWORD STANDARDS AND UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR WORKERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT . AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CURRENT PRESIDENT , I WILL MAKE TRADE UNKNOWNWORD A TOP PRIORITY AGAIN . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING POLICY , BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD A GREAT COUNTRY WITH A STRONG ECONOMY IF WE DON'T MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA . AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO SO . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO PASS UNKNOWNWORD THAT HELP PEOPLE BE ABLE TO JOIN UNIONS AND BARGAIN UNKNOWNWORD FOR GOOD UNKNOWNWORD AND FAIR BENEFITS AGAIN . WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON FAMILY UNKNOWNWORD , INSTEAD OF CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE FAMILY UNKNOWNWORD THE SUPPORT AND THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL . AND WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY CLOSE THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD AND STOP GIVING TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO COMPANIES THAT UNKNOWNWORD JOBS OVERSEAS . ENOUGH WITH UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN JOBS USING UNKNOWNWORD DOLLARS . [APPLAUSE ] BUT I'M GOING TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT : I WILL PROVIDE TAX RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS , BECAUSE YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT , GIVEN THE INCREASE IN ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD SINCE UNKNOWNWORD , ON AVERAGE UNKNOWNWORD , THAT IS FAR MORE THAN ANY UNKNOWNWORD FAMILY GOT OUT OF THESE BUSH TAX CUTS . WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO REAL TAX RELIEF FOR UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES . I'LL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUTS , GIVE UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO HELP FAMILIES AFFORD HEALTH CARE , OFFER UP TO UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUTS TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL EXPAND THE EARNED UNKNOWNWORD TAX CREDIT , INCREASE TAX CREDITS FOR CHILD CARE , AND PROVIDE A NEW UNKNOWNWORD TAX CREDIT TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO COLLEGE . [APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE MINIMUM WAGE TO CONGRESSIONAL SALARIES SO THAT CONGRESS CAN'T GET A RAISE UNTIL WORKING MEN AND WOMEN GET A RAISE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE . [APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT , BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW , UNKNOWNWORD ACTION TO FACE THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES . THAT STARTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD TO PREVENT AS MANY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS POSSIBLE . I'VE ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD OF POLICIES TO DO JUST THAT , INCLUDING A UNKNOWNWORD BILLION FUND TO HELP STATES WORK WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO PREVENT UNKNOWNWORD . TODAY , I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO UNKNOWNWORD A CRISIS UNKNOWNWORD , BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS , FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD TO COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD , TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS . THE TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IS OVER . WE NEED URGENT ACTION . AND INSTEAD OF JUST TRYING TO HELP THE BIG UNKNOWNWORD , HOW ABOUT HELPING AMERICA , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , TO DEAL WITH THIS UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING ? [APPLAUSE ] SECOND , WE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THE IMPENDING HOME UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS THAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD SO MANY FAMILIES THIS YEAR . NOW , THE ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO HIGH ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD IS REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY . I'VE UNKNOWNWORD A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO DO THAT THAT I TALKED ABOUT OUTSIDE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AT UNKNOWNWORD , AND OTHER PLACES THROUGHOUT IOWA , AND I HAVE SET GOALS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARD UNKNOWNWORD THAT . BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL WE SEE THE END OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION . AND I BELIEVE , IF WE DO IT , WE CAN CREATE FIVE MILLION NEW JOBS . YOU KNOW ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD JOBS AND UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . HOW ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD , DO THE WORK ON BIO-FUELS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ? BUT WITH OIL APPROACHING $100 A BARREL , IT'S GOING TO COST FAMILIES UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT TO 25 PERCENT MORE TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR HOMES THIS UNKNOWNWORD . TOO MANY FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THAT . SO I WAS UNKNOWNWORD LAST WEEK WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH VETOED EMERGENCY ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD FUNDING FOR FAMILIES . BECAUSE OF HIS VETO , STATE AGENCIES RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS AMERICA HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TURN AWAY UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES . IF PRESIDENT BUSH GETS HIS WAY , ONE MILLION FAMILIES WILL BE CUT OFF FROM UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD . I'VE LIVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE . THEY KEEP IT WARM IN THE WHITE HOUSE . AND MAYBE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND COME TO IOWA AND MEET SOME OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE GOING TO GET CUT OFF OF ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OF HIS VETO . I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO PUT UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD EMERGENCY UNKNOWNWORD TODAY , NOT MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD , WHEN MILLIONS OF SENIORS AND UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES HAVE LITERALLY BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD . LET'S UNKNOWNWORD THAT NO UNKNOWNWORD FAMILY GETS UNKNOWNWORD AWAY AND THAT UNKNOWNWORD KEEPS PACE WITH THE RISING ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD . IN ADDITION , WE SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLION TO AN EMERGENCY HOME CONSERVATION PROGRAM TO LOWER COSTS FOR FAMILIES IN UNKNOWNWORD STATES . THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW STATES TO MAKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO THREE MILLION FAMILIES . THESE UNKNOWNWORD WOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD , AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR YOUR WATER UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD FOR DOORS AND WINDOWS . WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THIS CAN REDUCE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILL BY UP TO UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO SET UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE THESE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD MORE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU KNOW , HERE IN AMERICA , WE WOULD NEVER FEAR PEOPLE FROM OTHER NATIONS WHO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD AND CREATE JOBS HERE . BUT WHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD IS A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT , WE NEED TO BE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD DON'T THREATEN OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY . CURRENTLY , THESE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD DON'T HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , THEIR INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD , THEIR INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD , OR THEIR MANAGEMENT UNKNOWNWORD , SO IT'S HARD TO UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER THEY'RE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD INTO OUR MARKETS , HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE BUYING OR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE A PROFIT OR MAKE A POINT . SO TODAY I CALL ON THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION , THE WORLD UNKNOWNWORD , THE INTERNATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD FUND TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THESE UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE CRITICAL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD . AND , FINALLY , WE NEED TO START UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD POSED BY UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD FINANCIAL PRODUCTS . YOU CAN'T LET WALL STREET SEND THE BILL TO YOUR STREET WITH THE BRIGHT IDEAS THAT JUST DON'T WORK OUT . UNKNOWNWORD AND PRODUCTS LIKE THEM ARE UNKNOWNWORD REAL UNKNOWNWORD TO FAMILIES , AS WALL STREET UNKNOWNWORD DOWN UNKNOWNWORD OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UNKNOWNWORD . COMPANIES ARE TAKING THE LOSS OF A BILLION HERE AND A BILLION THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY OWN ARE UNKNOWNWORD LESS THAN THEY THOUGHT . SO AS PRESIDENT , I WILL MOVE TO ESTABLISH THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WE NEED IN A UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL MARKETPLACE . I WILL CALL FOR AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THESE NEW INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND FOR PLANS TO MAKE THEM MORE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO IT BEFORE I'M UNKNOWNWORD IN . I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS OF POTENTIAL UNKNOWNWORD BEING UNKNOWNWORD INTO OUR ECONOMY WITH ALL OF THE OTHER UNKNOWNWORD AT WORK . YOU KNOW , PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT , WHO SAID A LOT OF REALLY SMART THINGS , SAID ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD ARE NOT MADE BY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY'RE MADE BY HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD . NEVER BEFORE HAS AMERICA BEEN AT SUCH AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD . THE THREATS TO OUR SUCCESS ARE MANY ; THEY'VE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND FAILED ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP AND AN EFFORT TO TURN OUR GOVERNMENT INTO A GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW , BY THE FEW , AND FOR THE FEW . BUT , YOU KNOW , AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD , AND I THINK WE'RE READY TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED . WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT READY TO CHANGE OUR POLICIES AND LEAD OUR PEOPLE . I BELIEVE I CAN PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP WE NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY REQUIRED , AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND YOUR HELP AS WE MAKE THIS JOURNEY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH . 
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD EVERYONE . I AM SO UNKNOWNWORD I CAN NOT BE WITH YOU IN PERSON TODAY . BUT I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEIR UNKNOWNWORD LEADERSHIP . AND I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , ONE OF MY CAMPAIGN UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP . FINALLY , I WANT TO HONOR ALL OF YOU UNKNOWNWORD HERE TODAY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE IN YOUR NATIONS -- AND FOR YOUR UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR SHARED FUTURE . YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT , TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD US TO EACH OTHER , TO MAKING DECISIONS BASED NOT ON JUST THEIR IMPACT TODAY -- BUT ON GENERATIONS TO COME -- IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO REMEMBER . UNFORTUNATELY , THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT ALWAYS HONORED ITS OBLIGATIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS -- AND UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY STILL UNKNOWNWORD THE EFFECTS EVERY SINGLE DAY . DURING THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , THE UNKNOWNWORD HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE . WE'VE SEEN FUNDING CUTS AND FAILURES TO HONOR UNKNOWNWORD SOVEREIGNTY . PRESIDENT BUSH HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD POSITION WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OFFICE -- A POSITION STARTED BY MY HUSBAND . FIVE OF THE EIGHT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WERE LEADERS IN UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . WELL , I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR A NEW BEGINNING . IT'S TIME FOR OUR GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER AS UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN , LIKE WE USED TO . I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD . I WAS HONORED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING MY TIME AS FIRST LADY AND TO WORK WITH UNKNOWNWORD LEADERS TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND'S UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD AND FUND UNKNOWNWORD NEW UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN TEACHERS . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL RESTORE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR SHARED MISSION TO LIFT UP OUR FAMILIES AND BUILD THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS DESERVE . I WILL START BY FULLY SUPPORTING UNKNOWNWORD SOVEREIGNTY AND UNKNOWNWORD THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- NOT JUST WITH TALK , BUT WITH ACTION . I'LL UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD ORDER THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR GOVERNMENT TO UNKNOWNWORD AND MEANINGFUL UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS . AND I WILL ALWAYS HONOR OUR FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY -- IT'S NOT JUST A LAW , IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL MORAL OBLIGATION , NOTHING LESS . SECOND , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS TO UNKNOWNWORD POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . I'LL RESTORE THE UNKNOWNWORD POSITION IN THE OFFICE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THIS PERSON WILL SERVE AS MY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD . AND I'LL WORK TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHERS WHO UNKNOWNWORD UNDERSTAND UNKNOWNWORD SOVEREIGNTY AND RESPECT THE NEEDS OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , IMPROVING HEALTHCARE IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY WILL BE AT THE TOP OF MY NATIONAL AGENDA . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE AVERAGE LIFE UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD IS NEARLY FIVE YEARS LESS THAN THE REST OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AS UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM DIABETES AND MORE THAN 50 % MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THAT WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD FOR EACH MEDICARE UNKNOWNWORD -- IT SPENDS ONLY UNKNOWNWORD PER PERSON FOR UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH SERVICE UNKNOWNWORD CARE . I WAS PROUD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE UNKNOWNWORD ACT UNKNOWNWORD . THIS BILL WILL EXPAND COVERAGE FOR QUALIFIED UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS IN THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM , A PROGRAM I HELPED TO CREATE AS FIRST LADY . IT WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH SERVICES UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , UNKNOWNWORD HEALTHCARE WILL BE A NATIONAL PRIORITY UNKNOWNWORD WITH QUALITY , AFFORDABLE CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILY . I WON'T REST UNTIL I GET IT DONE . UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL WORK EVERY DAY TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT EVERY CHILD IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY HAS THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . I'LL START RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING , BY UNKNOWNWORD FUNDING FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD HEAD START PROGRAM . A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM LAST SEPTEMBER UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD LANGUAGES ARE THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ENTIRE WORLD . THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY HEAD START IS CRITICAL . IT UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD LANGUAGES AND SUPPORT FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IN FACT , MORE THAN 80 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD HEAD START PROGRAMS . I'VE ALSO PROPOSED UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN FOR ALL UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN CHILDREN , BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD SHOW THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH A UNKNOWNWORD EARLY EDUCATION UNKNOWNWORD TO HIGHER UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD RATES AND UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . I'LL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND INSTITUTIONS SERVING UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN STUDENTS . THESE INSTITUTIONS UNKNOWNWORD A CRITICAL ROLE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TEACHING , COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD , AND RESEARCH SERVICES TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . SO IT'S TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM THE RESOURCES THEY DESERVE . UNKNOWNWORD , AS PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK TO IMPROVE UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILIES . TODAY , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE HOMELESS OR UNKNOWNWORD , AND AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . SO WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD IN BUILDING AND UNKNOWNWORD AFFORDABLE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . THAT MEANS BOTH UNKNOWNWORD FUNDING FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ACT . UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL WORK TO SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . I FULLY SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES . I'LL SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS BY UNKNOWNWORD AND EXPANDING UNKNOWNWORD PARTNERSHIPS TO PROMOTE UNKNOWNWORD , WIND , AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY . AS PART OF A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL WORK TO UNKNOWNWORD EVERY UNKNOWNWORD HOME IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . LAST UNKNOWNWORD , THE AVERAGE FUEL BILL FOR OUR FAMILIES WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD -- IT'S EXPECTED TO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD . SO UNKNOWNWORD HOMES IS A UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSITION : GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR OUR BUDGETS . UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED A UNKNOWNWORD FOCUS ON LAW UNKNOWNWORD EFFORTS ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . IT'S SIMPLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WHEN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD ARE TWICE AS UNKNOWNWORD TO BE UNKNOWNWORD OF VIOLENT UNKNOWNWORD , THERE ARE UNKNOWNWORD THAN HALF AS MANY UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS AS UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . AND WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS AFFECTING SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD , THE NEED FOR LAW UNKNOWNWORD RESOURCES IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY IS GREATER THAN EVER . I'LL START BY IMPROVING THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . WE CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD FIX THE PROBLEM UNKNOWNWORD WE UNKNOWNWORD UNDERSTAND IT . I'LL ALSO MAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD WE NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD UP LAW UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY AND PROMOTE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE UNKNOWNWORD AND KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE . FINALLY , ON THIS UNKNOWNWORD OF VETERANS DAY , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS PRESIDENT , I WILL STAND UP FOR OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY . AS YOU KNOW , UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SERVICE OF ANY GROUP IN AMERICA . AT THE END OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CENTURY , WE HAD NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN VETERANS IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO KEEP FAITH WITH THESE VETERANS -- TO PROVIDE THE HEALTHCARE AND BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED AND THE RESPECT AND UNKNOWNWORD THEY DESERVE . SO I'LL FULLY FUND THE UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL CUT THE RED UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL CREATE A NEW UNKNOWNWORD BILL FOR A NEW GENERATION OF VETERANS . I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN AND NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR US . IN CLOSING , I WANT AGAIN TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY -- IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME . AND I URGE YOU TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD IN THIS ELECTION . YOUR UNKNOWNWORD CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN ELECTING A PRESIDENT WHO IS A TRUE PARTNER WITH UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED , I WILL BE THAT PARTNER . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH . 
BLUE	THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU SO MUCH . THANK YOU IOWA DEMOCRATS . THANK YOU ALL . THANK YOU . WHAT A NIGHT . WHAT A GREAT , GREAT NIGHT . THANK YOU ALL . THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE THAN RIGHT HERE IN IOWA WITH THE GREAT ELECTED UNKNOWNWORD THAT YOU HAVE : YOUR UNKNOWNWORD , YOUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , YOUR CONGRESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD , OUR WONDERFUL FRIEND , SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD . ISN'T IT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO HAVE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE HOUSE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HERE TONIGHT ? [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , ON JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , SOMEONE WILL STAND ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND RAISE HIS OR HER HAND - [APPLAUSE ] - TO TAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OFFICE AS THE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AND WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEXT PRESIDENT IS A DEMOCRAT . [APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE , WE KNOW , AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GEORGE W . BUSH , SEVEN YEARS OF INCOMPETENCE , CRONYISM , AND CORRUPTION , SEVEN YEARS OF A GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW BY THE FEW AND FOR THE FEW . WE , AS A NATION CANNOT AFFORD ANY OTHER CHOICE . WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES TO MEET . WE HAVE A WAR TO END . WE HAVE AN ECONOMY TO UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE A 47 MILLION AMERICANS TO UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE AN ENERGY CRISIS TO SOLVE . WE HAVE A HOMELAND TO PROTECT , WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO REBUILD AND WE HAVE A WORLD TO LEAD . SO , WE ARE READY FOR CHANGE . [APPLAUSE ] BUT , YOU KNOW WHAT ? CHANGE , CHANGE IS JUST A UNKNOWNWORD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] WE MUST UNKNOWNWORD A NOMINEE WHO HAS BEEN TESTED , AND UNKNOWNWORD A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO LEAD ON DAY ONE . [APPLAUSE ] I KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO WIN . I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US AND MILLIONS MORE AND A CANDIDATE WHO WILL WORK AND FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN WILL GO INTO THE WHITE HOUSE DETERMINED TO BRING ABOUT THAT CHANGE THAT WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT . FORTUNATELY , I HAVE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE STANDING UP AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT AND WHAT I THINK AMERICA NEEDS AND HOW WE CAN GET THERE TOGETHER . [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE SPENT 35 YEARS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE UNKNOWNWORD TO PEOPLE . AS A YOUNG LAWYER , I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND , FIGHTING FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD KIDS , FIGHTING FOR KIDS IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CARE SYSTEM , FIGHTING FOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES , KIDS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE , KIDS WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITIES . IN ARKANSAS , I HELPED TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE INTO RURAL AREAS AND TO REFORM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THAT EVERY CHILD WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CONTINUE THOSE FIGHTS . CONTINUE SO THAT WE LEAVE NO PERSON AND NO CHILD OUT OF AMERICA'S PROMISE . AS FIRST LADY , I FOUGHT MY HEART OUT FOR HEALTH CARE , AND , WELL - [APPLAUSE ] - WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT TIME , BUT I AM SO PROUD THAT I UNKNOWNWORD A PART HELPING TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND TO UNKNOWNWORD 6 MILLION CHILDREN . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THE JOB AND PROVIDE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD . [APPLAUSE ] AND , AS SENATOR , I HAVE CONTINUED TO FIGHT FOR FAMILY FARMERS AND FOR WORKERS . TO FIGHT FOR SOLDIERS TO GET THE BODY UNKNOWNWORD THEY NEEDED , AND FOR FIRST UNKNOWNWORD TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY REQUIRED AFTER 9/11 . I HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND AGAINST THE FAILED POLICIES OF GEORGE W . BUSH AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . [APPLAUSE ] AND , WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL WORK TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE EIGHT YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH AND I WILL RESTORE THE PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN AMERICA THAT SHOULD BE OUR UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS WHO AMERICA IS . WE WANT TO BE PROUD AGAIN . WE WANT TO BE UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN AND WE WILL , WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE I STAND . WELL , I THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT . I STAND WHERE I HAVE STOOD FOR 35 YEARS . I STAND WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR CHILDREN , AND WITH EVERY AMERICAN WHO NEEDS A UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR CORNER FOR A BETTER LIFE . NOW , I KNOW HOW EASY IT IS IN A CAMPAIGN TO GET UNKNOWNWORD ; TO FOCUS ON WHO IS UP AND WHO IS DOWN , AND WHO SAYS WHAT ABOUT WHOM . BUT , THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THOSE IOWANS AND THOSE AMERICANS WHO FEEL INVISIBLE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY ; WHO FEEL INVISIBLE TO THEIR OWN PRESIDENT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE WOMAN I MET IN UNKNOWNWORD . SHE AND HER HUSBAND BOTH WORK REALLY HARD , BUT THEY HAD TO SELL HALF THE FAMILY FARM TO PAY THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT A UNKNOWNWORD I MET IN UNKNOWNWORD CENTER , WHO BRAVELY FOUGHT IN IRAQ AND CAME HOME AND HAD TO KEEP FIGHTING TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT HE NEEDED . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE MOTHER FROM UNKNOWNWORD , WHOSE DAUGHTER GOT SICK AND THEY DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE , AND SHE UNKNOWNWORD . AND ON HER DEATH UNKNOWNWORD , THEY COULD NOT EVEN PUT A CAUSE OF DEATH , BECAUSE NOBODY HAD EVER MADE A UNKNOWNWORD . SHE WAS JUST UNKNOWNWORD OLD . THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL NOT BE . WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT AGAIN , WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY , UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT , UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT , AND FIGHTS FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US . THAT'S WHAT AMERICA DESERVES , AND THAT IS WHAT MY CANDIDACY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , WE ARE GETTING UNKNOWNWORD TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES . THEY ARE GOING TO BE UNKNOWNWORD THAN EVER BEFORE . I KNOW AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON , THAT IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD OUT THERE . BUT THAT IS FINE WITH ME . BECAUSE , YOU KNOW , AS HARRY TRUMAN SAID , IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE UNKNOWNWORD , GET OUT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL TELL YOU WHAT , I FEEL REALLY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] SO , WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES , WHAT IS THIS ELECTION GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON ? WELL , I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO . I AM NOT INTERESTED IN UNKNOWNWORD MY OPPONENTS . I AM INTERESTED IN UNKNOWNWORD THE PROBLEMS OF AMERICA , AND I BELIEVE -- [APPLAUSE ] -- WE SHOULD BE TURNING UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE REPUBLICANS ; THEY DESERVE ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD WE CAN GIVE THEM . [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , YOU LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING THIS YEAR , THEY SEE EIGHT MORE YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH . THEY SEE A UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION UNKNOWNWORD DEBT AND SAY LET'S SPEND UNKNOWNWORD MORE . THEY SEE THAT WE HAD ONE UNKNOWNWORD TO WAR AND THEN SAY , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , WHY HAVE ONE MORE ? WELL , I THINK WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM , IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME . AMERICA IS DONE WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND THEIR FAILED POLICIES AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO GIVE AMERICA BACK THE FUTURE THAT WE DESERVE . BUT WE DEMOCRATS , WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE ARE FOR . WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE AMERICAN DREAM . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STAND BY AND UNKNOWNWORD RISING GAS UNKNOWNWORD AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND INCREASE IN COLLEGE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES , AND THEY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD CHINA INTO OUR UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS A GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL THAT WE WANT TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CUT HEAD START , AND REFUSE TO FIX NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ? WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WHEN WE DEMOCRATS FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THE REPUBLICANS VETO HEALTH CARE FOR CHILD AND THE LET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE FOR THE REST OF US , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN LABOR RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND UNKNOWNWORD RIGHTS , AND CIVIL RIGHTS . [APPLAUSE ] AND WE BELIEVE IN A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THAT IS ACTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD LABOR , AND A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TRIED TO TURN THE UNKNOWNWORD BACK ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS , WHEN THEY TRIED TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT LABOR UNIONS , WHEN THEY TRY TO UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL RIGHTS , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE BELIEVE IN SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TURN OVER OUR ENERGY POLICY TO THE OIL COMPANIES AND UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL WARMING , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS AGAIN . WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STOCK THE GOVERNMENT WITH THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN THEY GIVE NO-BID CONTRACTS TO HALLIBURTON AND LEGAL UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION . WE KNOW IT CAN LIFT UP LIVES AND GROW THE ECONOMY , SO WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH UNKNOWNWORD A WAR ON SCIENCE , WHEN HE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CELL RESEARCH , WHEN HE TRIES TO TURN WASHINGTON INTO AN UNKNOWNWORD FREE UNKNOWNWORD AND PUT IDEOLOGY IN FRONT OF UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! AND FINALLY , WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS BOTH GREAT AND GOOD . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE WAR IN IRAQ , END THE ERA OF UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY AND RESTORE AMERICA'S STANDING AND LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . [APPLAUSE ] SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND TALK ABOUT WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DO WE DO TO THEM ? TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ! WELL , THAT IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE . WE ARE GOING TO TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE REPUBLICANS AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN AMERICA AROUND . BUT , WE CANNOT DO IT IF WE ARE NOT UNITED AND TOGETHER ; NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS , BUT INDEPENDENTS , AND EVEN REPUBLICANS WHO REJECT THIS RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD IN EXTREMISM . I KNOW WE CAN WIN THIS ELECTION AND I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE . I AM PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA . AND I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS FROM THE SO - CALLED RED STATES TO KNOW THAT I CAN WIN . LEADERS LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF ARKANSAS AND SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHO IS HERE WITH ME TONIGHT . [APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE , DEMOCRATS KNOW , WHEN WE WIN UNKNOWNWORD , WE WIN THE WHITE HOUSE . [APPLAUSE ] I AM SO GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE IOWANS WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME AND I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN . I ASK ALL OF YOU TO JOIN MY CAMPAIGN . I ASK YOU TO GO AND STAND FOR ME IN THE CAUCUS ON JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD . IF YOU WILL STAND FOR ME FOR A NIGHT , I WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE . BECAUSE TOGETHER , WE ARE GOING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP , REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS UNKNOWNWORD , REFORM THE GOVERNMENT AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . LET'S DO IT , IOWA DEMOCRATS . LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE TURN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD AND TURN AMERICA AROUND . THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU . 
BLUE	THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . THANK YOU SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD . THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE . THIS IS SUCH AN UNKNOWNWORD DAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS UNKNOWNWORD BEING PART OF THE FUTURE THAT WE WILL MAKE TOGETHER FOR OUR COUNTRY . I WANT TO THANK SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE , HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD ON RENEWABLE ENERGY , HE'S UNKNOWNWORD ON THE FUTURE WE NEED FOR OUR CHILDREN . AND I'M THRILLED TO HAVE SO MANY OTHERS HERE WITH ME TODAY . I WANT TO THANK COUNTY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD LABOR COUNCIL . I WANT TO THANK STATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I WANT TO THANK STATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO THANK MY DEAR FRIEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO'S WITH ME AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING AND YOU'RE DOING . YOU'RE MAKING IT UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT , ASKING THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IOWA FOR YOUR SUPPORT , THAT WE TELL YOU WHAT WE WILL DO WHEN WE'RE PRESIDENT TO DEAL WITH THE BIG PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA . AND TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE . TWO YEARS AGO AS PART OF A UNKNOWNWORD CONGRESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD , I TRAVELED TO UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S THE UNKNOWNWORD MOST POINT OF THE UNITED STATES . AND I ALSO TRAVELED THROUGH ON MY WAY THERE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN CANADA . TRAVELING OVER THOSE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT BLANKET THOSE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I LOOKED DOWN TO SEE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS FAR AS THE UNKNOWNWORD COULD REACH . THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE PART OF AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD BRUTAL CONDITIONS . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , SOME UNKNOWNWORD OLD , ARE NO UNKNOWNWORD FOR A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD : A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD KNOWN AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD , IT TURNS OUT , WERE ONCE PROTECTED BY COLD , COLD UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD COULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD . BUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE ALLOWED THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO TRAVEL INTO HIGHER UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IN ONCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THERE WAS UNKNOWNWORD . MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WHOLE UNKNOWNWORD OF LAND - ONCE GREEN - NOW UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN WE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD EVERYONE I UNKNOWNWORD TO HAD A PERSONAL WAKE UP CALL ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CLIMATE . A UNKNOWNWORD TO A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD UP UNKNOWNWORD . A UNKNOWNWORD VILLAGE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . I MET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO TOLD ME THEY NO LONGER EVEN NEEDED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING THOSE UNKNOWNWORD . AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD , YOU HEAR STORIES -- UNKNOWNWORD BY DECADES OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD -- OF CHANGING WEATHER UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNPRECEDENTED UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . YOU CAN SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD WITH YOUR OWN EYES . THERE ARE NO CLIMATE CHANGE UNKNOWNWORD INSIDE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . OF COURSE , THIS IS A UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT A PLACE THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HERE , IN ONE OF THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD REGIONS OF OUR PLANET . BUT I SHARE IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN UNKNOWNWORD EXPERIENCE ANY LONGER . IT IS A PART OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS PART OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD CLIMATE CHANGES , A STAGNANT ECONOMY , OUR HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD , OUR NATIONAL SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD -- BECAUSE OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD TO MOVE TO A CLEAN , EFFICIENT ENERGY FUTURE . IT IS OUR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CHANGES TO OUR WAY OF LIFE . THE LAST TWO DECADES OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CENTURY WERE THE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD YEARS . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE FOUND THAT UNKNOWNWORD OF THE PAST 12 YEARS ARE AMONG THE UNKNOWNWORD SINCE UNKNOWNWORD . RISING UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNITED STATES COULD COST UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN THE COMING DECADES . BEYOND OUR UNKNOWNWORD , YOU HAVE UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES UNKNOWNWORD WATER STRESS , UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S OUR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL THREATENS OUR ECONOMY . AMERICA'S NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY HAS TAKEN A UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . GAS UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS . NATIONWIDE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HIT AN UNKNOWNWORD HIGH . YOU KNOW GASOLINE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UPON WHERE YOU SHOP , ARE AROUND UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD . TWO UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICANS NOW SAY THAT RISING GAS UNKNOWNWORD ARE A UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEIR FAMILIES . ONE IN FOUR LOW UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD OR A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OF RISING ENERGY COSTS . UNKNOWNWORD , WE ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL TODAY THAN WE WERE ON 9/11 . AND ONE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR TRADE UNKNOWNWORD IS THE UNKNOWNWORD WE UNKNOWNWORD , AS WE TRANSFER MASSIVE UNKNOWNWORD OF WEALTH TO UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS THAT USE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD OPPOSITION AND FINANCE EXTREMISM . IT'S OUR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THE CARBON ECONOMY UNKNOWNWORD OUR HEALTH , THE UNKNOWNWORD WE BREATHE , AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE RAISE OUR CHILDREN . ONE UNKNOWNWORD FOUND THAT UNKNOWNWORD FROM POWER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR COUNTRY EACH YEAR . NEARLY A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR CHILDHOOD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE CAUSED BY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND FINALLY , IT'S OUR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OUR PATH TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS UNKNOWNWORD A WAR ON SCIENCE ITSELF . POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON GLOBAL WARMING , UNKNOWNWORD CLIMATE EXPERTS . UNKNOWNWORD TO A UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS , NEARLY THREE UNKNOWNWORD OF CLIMATE EXPERTS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN CLIMATE RESEARCH . AND JUST THIS PAST UNKNOWNWORD , THE ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD ORDER TO UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SERVICE UNKNOWNWORD THEM TO SPEAK ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF AN ALL OUT OPTIMISTIC UNKNOWNWORD ON THE PROBLEM , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD ON THE PROBLEM SOLVERS . THE PRESIDENT TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO RECOGNIZE CLIMATE CHANGE . HE REFUSED REALLY TO UNKNOWNWORD IN TALKS WITH OTHER GLOBAL LEADERS AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND EVEN TRIED TO STOP UNKNOWNWORD STATES FROM TAKING THEIR OWN ACTION TO REDUCE UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS UNDER THE CLEAN UNKNOWNWORD ACT . THIS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE FACED IN A GENERATION . IT IS A CHALLENGE TO OUR ECONOMY , TO OUR SECURITY , TO OUR HEALTH , AND TO OUR PLANET . AND IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO MEET IT . IT IS TIME TO GET BACK INTO THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS . AND THAT IS WHAT AMERICA DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE . [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , WHEN AMERICA CONFRONTED A GREAT DEPRESSION , WE DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD OUR HANDS . WE UNKNOWNWORD UP OUR SLEEVES . TRY UNKNOWNWORD UP YOUR SLEEVES WHILE YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD YOUR HANDS . IT CAN'T BE DONE . AND WE CREATED THE NEW DEAL AND UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY . WHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION WAS CALLED UPON TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM UNKNOWNWORD IN WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , OUR WHOLE COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD . WHILE YOUNG MEN FOUGHT OVERSEAS , AMERICANS DID THEIR PART TO SUPPORT THE WAR EFFORT HERE AT HOME . WHEN THE SOVIET UNION UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE DIDN'T UNKNOWNWORD THE CHALLENGE OR UNKNOWNWORD THE SCIENTISTS WHO WANTED TO GET OUT AND MEET IT . INSTEAD , WITHIN ONE YEAR , PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD HAD CREATED THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CREATED UNKNOWNWORD , AND PASSED THE NATIONAL DEFENSE EDUCATION ACT THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS AND UNKNOWNWORD . OUR NATION WAS SO UNITED AND DETERMINED THAT WE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD CALL TO LAND AN AMERICAN ON THE MOON AND RETURN HIM UNKNOWNWORD TO EARTH WITHIN THE DECADE . FOR THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS , CLIMATE CHANGE IS OUR SPACE RACE . IT IS OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD AND IT IS OUR UNKNOWNWORD TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION . UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL UNKNOWNWORD EVERY PART OF OUR COUNTRY , UNKNOWNWORD EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS , COST JOBS , AND UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD . I'M VERY PROUD THAT UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT GORE AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE JUST WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL OF US MUST UNKNOWNWORD TO . [APPLAUSE ] THERE ARE ALSO SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD . A GROUP OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD REPORT DESCRIBING IN UNKNOWNWORD THE THREAT THAT GLOBAL WARMING POSES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY , FROM INCREASED UNKNOWNWORD OVER NATURAL RESOURCES TO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THIS YEAR , THE SENATE PASSED MY LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS ISSUE INTO OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND FOR THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD IS FAR HIGHER THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ACTION . I BELIEVE AMERICA IS READY TO TAKE ACTION , TO BREAK THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE OLD ENERGY ECONOMY , TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY . UNKNOWNWORD IT WILL UNLEASH A UNKNOWNWORD OF INNOVATION , CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS , UNKNOWNWORD OUR SECURITY , AND LEAD THE WORLD IN A REVOLUTION IN HOW WE PRODUCE AND USE ENERGY . IT CAN LITERALLY BE A NEW BEGINNING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY . [APPLAUSE ] AFTER 35 YEARS OF UNKNOWNWORD ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES , I BELIEVE SOLVING THE CLIMATE AND ENERGY CRISIS IS CRITICAL TO LEAVING OUR CHILDREN A WORLD AS HEALTHY AND UNKNOWNWORD AS THE ONE WE INHERITED . [APPLAUSE ] AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SEVEN YEARS IN THE SENATE , I BELIEVE I KNOW HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE . I KNOW THAT A TRUE AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD US A WAY NOT JUST TO UNKNOWNWORD THE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD , BUT TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD OUR POLITICS AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR FUTURE . THERE IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO DO , AND SUCCESS WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US DO OUR PART . SO , IF YOU'RE READY FOR CHANGE , I AM READY TO LEAD . [APPLAUSE ] WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE WILL SET THREE MAJOR ENERGY GOALS FOR AMERICA . ONE , TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 80 PERCENT FROM UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY UNKNOWNWORD , THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO AVOID THE MOST DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWNWORD CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE . [APPLAUSE ] TWO , TO CUT FOREIGN OIL IMPORTS BY TWO UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY UNKNOWNWORD TO MOVE AMERICA TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . AND THREE , TO MOVE US FROM A UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY TO AN EFFICIENT , GREEN ECONOMY BY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD INNOVATION IN CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY . I BELIEVE THAT WILL CREATE AT LEAST FIVE MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS FROM CLEAN ENERGY OVER THE NEXT DECADE . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ? WELL , FIRST , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LEAD A NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY . THIS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WAY TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND SAVE ENERGY COSTS , AND TO CREATE GOOD NEW JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED . THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE CAN REDUCE ENERGY USE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD % BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT I BELIEVE . BY SOME UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE FUTURE GROWTH IN ENERGY DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA , ALL OF IT , COULD BE MET THROUGH UNKNOWNWORD IN EFFICIENCY ALONE . AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS . SINCE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL NEW DEMAND HAS BEEN MET SIMPLY BY USING ENERGY MORE UNKNOWNWORD . OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES , UNKNOWNWORD HAS HELD ITS ELECTRICITY USE PER PERSON UNKNOWNWORD . IN OTHER WORDS , THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY USE PER PERSON IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD YEARS . THEY'VE DONE IT THROUGH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY . DURING THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD YEAR UNKNOWNWORD , ENERGY DEMAND IN THE REST OF COUNTRY , UNKNOWNWORD BY 50 UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE'VE ALL GONE UP 50 UNKNOWNWORD NOW , DID UNKNOWNWORD GET LEFT BEHIND ? DID PEOPLE FLEE UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE ? JUST THE UNKNOWNWORD . IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD . A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THIS YEAR BY THE UNIVERSITY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOUND THAT CUTTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY UNKNOWNWORD , THROUGH FURTHER UNKNOWNWORD IN EFFICIENCY , COULD CREATE MORE THAN 1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN UNKNOWNWORD ALONE . AND IF AMERICAN ELECTRICITY USE HAD UNKNOWNWORD AT THE SAME RATE AS UNKNOWNWORD USE , OUR WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE USING UNKNOWNWORD % LESS ELECTRICITY TODAY . SO WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY EFFICIENCY QUICKLY WILL BE PRIORITY ONE . WE WILL SET A UNKNOWNWORD OF REDUCING ELECTRICITY DEMANDS UNKNOWNWORD % BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY UTILITIES MAKE MONEY . TODAY THE INCENTIVES ARE UNKNOWNWORD . THE LESS WE UNKNOWNWORD , THE MORE CARBON WE UNKNOWNWORD , THE MORE MONEY UTILITIES EARN . WE'LL CHANGE THAT WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNKNOWNWORD FOR UTILITIES AND INCENTIVES FOR UNKNOWNWORD POWER INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD MORE OF IT . THIS UNKNOWNWORD SIMPLE CHANGE , CALLED UNKNOWNWORD , HAS TRANSFORMATIONAL POTENTIAL BECAUSE UTILITIES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO HELP BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES MAKE UNKNOWNWORD IN EFFICIENCY . UNKNOWNWORD STATES ALREADY HAVE SOME FORM OF EFFICIENCY GOALS FOR UTILITIES AND MORE UTILITIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD THAT AS WELL . UNKNOWNWORD PERMITS A UTILITY TO UNKNOWNWORD IN EFFICIENCY . UNKNOWNWORD POWER AND OTHER UTILITIES HAVE COMMITTED TO GO BEYOND THAT . THEY ARE OFFERING ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD TO ALL OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . THEY'RE HELPING THEIR UNKNOWNWORD COME UP WITH PLANS TO CUT CONSUMPTION AND TO FINANCE THE UNKNOWNWORD OVER UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD YEARS , AS IF EFFICIENCY UNKNOWNWORD WERE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT WORKS LIKE THIS : THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD POWER AND COLD RESISTANT UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD CUT YOUR UTILITY BILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UTILITY UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD COST OF THOSE UNKNOWNWORD AND THEN A UNKNOWNWORD OF THE EFFICIENCY SAVINGS GOES TO YOU TO CUT YOUR BILLS , AND THE OTHER GOES TO THE UTILITIES TO PAY OFF THE COST OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU GET A LOWER UTILITY BILL , THEY GET MORE POWER WITH NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS . IN THE PROCESS A LOT OF JOBS ARE CREATED - UNKNOWNWORD THE NEW UNKNOWNWORD , MANUFACTURING , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE SYSTEM IS UNKNOWNWORD FRIENDLY , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN BUILDING A NEW POWER PLANT . A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BUILD THINGS FOR A LIVING , SAY 'WELL , BUT IF WE DON'T KEEP BUILDING POWER UNKNOWNWORD , WE'RE GOING TO LOSE JOBS .' IT'S JUST THE UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE'RE BUILDING MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WE'RE GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS . THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE FOR US . ONCE WE HAVE NATIONWIDE UNKNOWNWORD , EVERY UTILITY SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD OF SYSTEM AND UNKNOWNWORD EFFICIENCY BEFORE BUILDING ANY NEW POWER UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING . AT YOUR OFFICE , YOU UNKNOWNWORD HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD TIMES MORE POWERFUL AND HALF THE UNKNOWNWORD THAN COMPUTERS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO . AN UNKNOWNWORD CAN HOLD MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN YOU CAN LISTEN TO IN A MONTH . WE CAN TALK TO ANYONE , UNKNOWNWORD , AT ANY TIME USING 21ST CENTURY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY , WHICH HAS UNKNOWNWORD OUR ECONOMY . BUT ALL OF THIS DEPENDS ON A POWER UNKNOWNWORD ALL BUT UNKNOWNWORD IN HALF A CENTURY . IT IS TIME TO START BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY UNKNOWNWORD . RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . THE ONLY UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN YOUR HOME AND THE UNKNOWNWORD IS THE POWER YOU DRAW . BUT WHAT IF WE HARNESSED ALL OF THE ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ? IMAGINE IF YOU COULD TIME YOUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , OR YOUR UNKNOWNWORD OR YOU UNKNOWNWORD TO TURN ON WHEN DEMAND FOR POWER WAS LESS AND THE COST LOWER . IMAGINE IF YOU COULD UNKNOWNWORD YOUR CAR IN YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AT NIGHT , AND SELL POWER BACK TO THE UTILITY WHEN YOUR CAR IS UNKNOWNWORD AT WORK DURING THE HOURS OF UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY DEMAND . IMAGINE IF YOU COULD SELL BACK THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER YOU GENERATE WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . IMAGINE IF THE SYSTEM COULD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CUTTING UNKNOWNWORD DEMAND TO AVOID UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD POWER AND SAVE MONEY . JUST A UNKNOWNWORD % DROP IN UNKNOWNWORD DEMAND WOULD SAVE UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN ENERGY COSTS OVER 10 YEARS . WE CAN HARNESS THIS TECHNOLOGY . AS PRESIDENT I WILL FUND TEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ," PROVIDE SMART UNKNOWNWORD TAX INCENTIVES TO UTILITIES AND ENCOURAGE STATE UTILITY UNKNOWNWORD TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES AS WELL . WE WILL ALSO MAKE UNKNOWNWORD MORE EFFICIENT , UNKNOWNWORD CONSUMERS UNKNOWNWORD BILLION BETWEEN NOW AND UNKNOWNWORD . YOU KNOW THE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESSFUL ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM UNKNOWNWORD VALUABLE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW TO SAVE ENERGY AND SAVE MONEY BY UNKNOWNWORD MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTS . LET'S TAKE IT FURTHER AND CREATE A CLIMATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION TO UNKNOWNWORD THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY BUY . WE WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD -- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PIONEERED . I THINK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WOULD SUPPORT THIS IDEA . IN FACT , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BE THERE HELPING US DEVELOP THE UNKNOWNWORD -- FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - THEY MAY LOOK UNKNOWNWORD - THEY USE A UNKNOWNWORD THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND LAST UNKNOWNWORD TO 10 TIMES LONGER THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE MOVE TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , OR OTHER UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD ALTERNATIVES , WE WILL CUT OUR NATIONAL ELECTRIC BILL BY MORE THAN $10 BILLION OVER JUST UNKNOWNWORD YEARS . I ALSO WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD A GREEN BUILDING FUND TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLION PER YEAR INTO ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD LIKE SCHOOLS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL HELP UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES UNKNOWNWORD THEIR HOMES TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT . UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT FOR UNKNOWNWORD % OF AMERICA'S CARBON EMISSIONS -- AND THERE ARE SO MANY SIMPLE , COST EFFECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD WE CAN TAKE TO REDUCE UNKNOWNWORD BILLS , LIGHT BILLS , SAVE TAXPAYERS ' MONEY , AND CUT UNKNOWNWORD . IN THE PROCESS WE CAN CREATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS . I WILL ALSO CREATE A PROGRAM CALLED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ," THAT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ASSOCIATION . THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THAT UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT GORE HAS UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD COST OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND EFFICIENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FOR EXAMPLE , ARE OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD LOOKING TO SAVE MONEY -- EVEN THOUGH THESE GREEN PRODUCTS ACTUALLY PAY FOR THEMSELVES IN LOWER UTILITY BILLS . CONNIE UNKNOWNWORD WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO SECURE AFFORDABLE UNKNOWNWORD FROM PRIVATE UNKNOWNWORD TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY IN THEIR OWN HOME . IT'S A WIN FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND THE PLANET . YESTERDAY NIGHT I WAS AT THE GREAT RIVER UNKNOWNWORD CENTER . IT'S IN WEST UNKNOWNWORD , AND I LEARNED IT IS THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT HOSPITAL IN AMERICA . THIS IS HAPPENING IN IOWA RIGHT NOW . IT'S JUST HAPPENING SO UNKNOWNWORD AND ON SUCH AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE DON'T UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN GET . THE GREAT RIVER UNKNOWNWORD CENTER IS UNKNOWNWORD BY THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM . I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY UNKNOWNWORD . RIGHT HERE IN IOWA . THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT HOSPITAL IN AMERICA . [APPLAUSE ] THE SECOND UNKNOWNWORD OF MY AGENDA UNKNOWNWORD THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO SET THE UNKNOWNWORD AND LEAD THE WAY . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL PUT IN PLACE A MARKET-BASED UNKNOWNWORD AND TRADE SYSTEM TO REDUCE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD . HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK : THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD PERMITS FOR UNKNOWNWORD % OF THE NATION'S CARBON UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS . COMPANIES PURCHASE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD BUT THEY CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE MARKET WILL DETERMINE THE COST OF CARBON UNKNOWNWORD AND COMPANIES WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD FOR CUTTING EMISSIONS . IN UNKNOWNWORD WITH EFFICIENCY , FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS AND OTHER PROPOSALS , THIS SYSTEM WILL UNKNOWNWORD WE MEET OUR UNKNOWNWORD OF REDUCING OUR UNKNOWNWORD TO GLOBAL WARMING BELOW UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY 80 UNKNOWNWORD WE KNOW THIS CAN WORK . IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID IN THE UNKNOWNWORD TO REDUCE UNKNOWNWORD RAIN , CUTTING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS BY 10 MILLION UNKNOWNWORD BELOW UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS . WHILE SETTING DOWN THE UNKNOWNWORD , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO SET AN EXAMPLE . ALL NEW FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD DESIGNED AFTER UNKNOWNWORD JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT , WILL HAVE TO BE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD -- THAT IS ZERO EMISSIONS . NO NEW FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD THAT DON'T MEET THAT UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD DEVELOPMENT TO STRENGTHEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD AND DEVELOP UNKNOWNWORD STANDARDS FOR ALL NEW UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE WILL MAKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY A UNKNOWNWORD MISSION FOR THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES ADMINISTRATION , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD . I ALSO WANT TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS GO GREEN . MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD A PLEDGE TO CUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MEET THE STANDARDS SET BY THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL ASK AUTOMAKERS TO UNKNOWNWORD A ROLE . TODAY , YOUR CAR MAY HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE FRONT AND SIDE IMPACT UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , TECHNOLOGY THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CHANGES IN ROAD CONDITIONS . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL HE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD . BECAUSE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE SAME BASIC UNKNOWNWORD THAT HE PUT IN TO THE UNKNOWNWORD T ALMOST A CENTURY AGO . IN FACT , THAT UNKNOWNWORD T GOT BETTER GAS MILEAGE THAN YOUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DOES TODAY . WE CAN'T CONTINUE THIS . IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE . FOR TWO DECADES , UNKNOWNWORD . FUEL ECONOMY HAS UNKNOWNWORD . CARS AND LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT FOR UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF OIL UNKNOWNWORD EVERY DAY IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD DO WHAT WE DO BEST : LEAD THE INNOVATION RACE . IMAGINE IF OVER THE PAST CENTURY , UNKNOWNWORD ADVANCED AS FAR IN UNKNOWNWORD OUR CARS AS WE HAVE IN KEEPING OUR CARS SAFE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL RAISE THE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS TO UNKNOWNWORD MILES PER UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] THAT WILL SAVE CONSUMERS MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION DOLLARS IN FUEL BILLS EACH YEAR AND SAVE US UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF OIL EACH DAY . BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK THE AUTO COMPANIES TO DO IT ALONE . I WANT TO BE A PARTNER , A GOOD PARTNER , TO HELP THEM UNKNOWNWORD TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . I'LL PROVIDE $20 BILLION IN UNKNOWNWORD VEHICLE UNKNOWNWORD " TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD AUTOMAKERS UNKNOWNWORD THEIR OLDER UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD NEW , MORE EFFICIENT CARS AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE'VE ALSO GOT TO UNKNOWNWORD MORE IN NEW BATTERIES , UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES . I WILL CREATE A TAX CREDIT TO HELP AUTO UNKNOWNWORD COVER THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE AND UNKNOWNWORD COSTS THEY FACE . NEXT , WE'LL ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION OF PLUG-IN HYBRIDS . THESE ARE VEHICLES THAT CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD UP AT THE GAS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UP IN A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . A VEHICLE UNKNOWNWORD BY ELECTRICITY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LESS GLOBAL WARMING UNKNOWNWORD , EVEN IF THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM COAL . THESE CARS CAN OFFER THE PROMISE OF UNKNOWNWORD MILES TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF THE PLUG-IN IS A UNKNOWNWORD VEHICLE RUNNING ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT COULD UNKNOWNWORD TRAVEL UNKNOWNWORD MILES FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF GAS UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , THE GOOD NEWS IS , UNKNOWNWORD IS ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD THIS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY . IT IS POISED TO BE A WORLD LEADER . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PLANS TO BRING A PLUG-IN HYBRID TO MARKET IN UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD IS LOOKING AT UNKNOWNWORD AS WELL . BUT THE PLUG-IN REVOLUTION CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD FAST ENOUGH . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE THE COST , IMPROVE THE CAPACITY AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD BATTERIES . I WILL OFFER CONSUMERS A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD A PLUG-IN HYBRID . AND I WANT TO ADD 100,000 PLUG-IN HYBRIDS TO THE FEDERAL FLEET BY 2015 . AT THE SAME TIME , WE'VE GOT TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION . FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD YOU TRAVEL ON A UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD OR A UNKNOWNWORD INSTEAD OF IN A CAR , YOU PRODUCE UNKNOWNWORD % LESS CARBON UNKNOWNWORD AND HALF AS MUCH CARBON UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE HAVE CLEAN UNKNOWNWORD , MORE EFFICIENT UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD COULD EVEN BE GREATER . I WANT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD BY MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION EACH YEAR AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT TO SMART POLICIES THAT DISCOURAGE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , WE'LL ASK THE OIL COMPANIES TO DO THEIR PART . I HAVE PROPOSED A UNKNOWNWORD BILLION STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE . HERE'S HOW WE'LL PAY FOR IT -- BY ENDING THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT OIL COMPANIES RECEIVE TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING OIL DEPENDENCE ECONOMY . [APPLAUSE ] OIL IS NOW OVER UNKNOWNWORD A BARREL . A LOT OF UNKNOWNWORD THINK IT'S GOING TO GET TO OVER $100 A BARREL . THE OIL COMPANIES DON'T NEED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO HELP THEM . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE MADE THE HIGHEST UNKNOWNWORD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD A CHOICE : PAY INTO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND OR UNKNOWNWORD MORE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY . WE CANNOT LET THE MIDDLE CLASS PAY TWICE TO SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS , IN HIGHER UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND IN UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD TO A GREEN ECONOMY . A UNKNOWNWORD OF THE OIL COMPANIES ' UNKNOWNWORD SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL HELP AMERICA THE WORLD'S LEADER IN UNKNOWNWORD THAT TECHNOLOGY . I WILL ALSO REQUIRE OIL COMPANIES AND OTHER MAJOR GASOLINE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT HALF OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND ALL OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN TEN . IT'S TIME FOR THE OIL COMPANIES TO BECOME ENERGY COMPANIES . THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEY MUST BEGIN TO DO IT . UNKNOWNWORD , WE WILL SUPPORT THE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES , THE UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS , THE UNKNOWNWORD ENTREPRENEURS AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO ARE DRIVING THE NEXT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD US IN THE PRODUCTION OF UNKNOWNWORD , WIND , UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD TECHNOLOGIES . WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE INNOVATION NATION , AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO LEAD AGAIN . TOMORROW , I WILL BE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MY ENERGY JOBS AGENDA . BUT WE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] IN A FEW UNKNOWNWORD YEARS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAS SET AN EXAMPLE OF HOW UNKNOWNWORD CLEAN ENERGY CAN CREATE GOOD JOBS . THIS IS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOOT UNKNOWNWORD . YOU EMPLOY MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE HELPING TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE NEXT GENERATION OF WIND TECHNOLOGY . JUST ONE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD BY THESE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS REALLY THE BRAIN OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , CAN POWER UNKNOWNWORD HOMES WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD ANY UNKNOWNWORD AT ALL . [APPLAUSE ] AS PRESIDENT , I WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND FOR OTHER COMPANIES AND INNOVATORS WHO ARE NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD TO THEIR UNKNOWNWORD LINE AND UNKNOWNWORD JOBS , BUT I THINK BEING REAL PATRIOTS . THIS IS THE NEW CHALLENGE . WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY ? END OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND AN OLD ENERGY SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR GROWTH AND OUR FUTURE . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ALSO INCREASE THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR BIOFUELS TO UNKNOWNWORD BILLION UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD , WITH ALMOST HALF OF THAT COMING FROM ADVANCED BIOFUELS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE WILL ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION OF ADVANCED COAL TECHNOLOGY . COAL CURRENTLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OUR ELECTRICITY IN AMERICA , BUT IT COMES AT A HIGH UNKNOWNWORD IN GREENHOUSE GASES AND OTHER POLLUTANTS . WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN UNKNOWNWORD CAPTURE AND UNKNOWNWORD CARBON UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS . THAT IS WHY I WILL PROVIDE FUNDING IMMEDIATELY FOR 10 UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AT THE SAME TIME , WE NEED TO STOP BUILDING COAL UNKNOWNWORD THE WAY WE HAVE IN THE PAST . I WILL REQUIRE UTILITY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER THE ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD MAKES POSSIBLE CAN MEET EXPECTED DEMAND BEFORE UNKNOWNWORD ANY NEW COAL PLANT . IN ANY EVENT , I WILL REQUIRE ALL NEW COAL UNKNOWNWORD TO BE BUILT SO THAT CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADDED AS SOON AS IT IS UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD SUPPORT A RENEWABLE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WITH 25 % OF ELECTRICITY COMING FROM WIND , UNKNOWNWORD , AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES BY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH TIME IN THE LAST YEARS . TODAY AMERICA PRODUCES BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD % AND UNKNOWNWORD % OF OUR POWER THROUGH RENEWABLE SOURCES . UNKNOWNWORD , DENMARK PLANS TO MEET ONE HALF OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS WITH WIND BY UNKNOWNWORD . LAST YEAR , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HALF OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD ELECTRICITY . WHILE THESE COUNTRIES PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE , THEIR COMPANIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD NEW TECHNOLOGIES AROUND THE WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR ECONOMIES AND UNKNOWNWORD NEW JOBS . IN JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY ADDED UNKNOWNWORD NEW JOBS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY . AS A POINT OF UNKNOWNWORD , SINCE WE HAVE ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY HAVE ; THEY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION , WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER UNKNOWNWORD MILLION , WE COULD HAVE ADDED SOME UNKNOWNWORD GOOD JOBS FROM THE SAME SOURCES IF WE HAD BEEN LEADING THE WAY INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND CLEAN ENERGY WILL ALSO IMPROVE BOTH THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES . UNKNOWNWORD RATES ARE UNKNOWNWORD IN PART BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE PRODUCE ENERGY . NO ONE , CAN ANY LONGER , IGNORE THE HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY . THE INTERNATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SOME UNKNOWNWORD AT THE 2008 UNKNOWNWORD IN BEIJING UNKNOWNWORD TO POOR UNKNOWNWORD QUALITY . SO CHINA IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS STANDARDS TO CLEAN UP THE UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE THE GAMES BEGIN . AS PRESIDENT , TO HELP US REACH 25 % BY UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL MAKE THE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT FOR WIND AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR PRODUCTION . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ALSO PROVIDE TAX INCENTIVES FOR HOMES AND BUSINESSES TO UNKNOWNWORD TECHNOLOGIES , AND ESTABLISH A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD -- SO , FAMILIES AND COMPANIES THAT UNKNOWNWORD THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN SELL POWER BACK TO THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR A FAIR UNKNOWNWORD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY . THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN SOME STATES , BUT IT STOPS AT THE UNKNOWNWORD . WE NEED TO MAKE IT NATIONAL . FINALLY , THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND I'VE PROPOSED WILL DOUBLE INVESTMENT IN ENERGY RESEARCH AND UNKNOWNWORD IN A NEW UNKNOWNWORD CALLED THE ENERGY ADVANCED RESEARCH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO BRING TOGETHER THE BEST MINDS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO THINK OUTSIDE THE UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE HAVE THE BEST MINDS THINKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO KNOWS WHAT WE WOULD CREATE ? WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS . THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT HELPED US WIN THE SPACE RACE , THAT LITERALLY UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERNET , CAN BE THE WAY WE DEAL WITH OUR NEW ENERGY CHALLENGES . AMERICA CAN LEAD THE WORLD'S GREEN REVOLUTION . OUR UNKNOWNWORD CAPACITY , OUR CAPITAL MARKETS , OUR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNMATCHED . WE ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD , LET'S START ACTING LIKE WE'RE THE BEST AGAIN . [APPLAUSE UNKNOWNWORD THIS WILL CREATE AT LEAST UNKNOWNWORD MILLION JOBS . UNKNOWNWORD HEARD OF WHITE UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . UNKNOWNWORD HEARD OF BLUE UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . THESE WILL BE NEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD " JOBS ALL ACROSS AMERICA . [APPLAUSE ] THINK ABOUT IT . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JOBS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD GREEN UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JOBS UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND BUILDING GREEN UNKNOWNWORD . FARM JOBS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JOBS IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . MANAGEMENT JOBS IN NEW , CLEAN ENERGY COMPANIES . HIGH TECH JOBS DEVELOPING NEW , AFFORDABLE UNKNOWNWORD OF CLEAN ENERGY . AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST , MANUFACTURING JOBS BUILDING WIND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER PRODUCTS , JUST LIKE HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD OUR OWN CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WILL ENABLE AMERICA TO UNKNOWNWORD AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN UNKNOWNWORD THE WORLD'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . WE CAN'T MEET THESE CHALLENGES ALONE . WE COULD BE AS CLEAN AS ALL OF US HOPE TO BE IN 10 , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD YEARS , IF OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA ARE UNKNOWNWORD THE ATMOSPHERE , ALL OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WILL GET UP IN THE WIND UNKNOWNWORD AND FALL RIGHT DOWN ON US . WE CAN'T JUST ACT LIKE THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED OUR LEADERSHIP THE WAY WE HAVE FOR THE LAST 6 AND HALF YEARS . OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA , THEY SEE WE'VE DONE NOTHING . THEY FEEL FREE , UNKNOWNWORD , TO DO VERY LITTLE . THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE CAN LEAD . WE HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT MOVING AWAY FROM A CARBON ECONOMY IS GOOD FOR GROWTH AND LEAD THE WORLD TO A NEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO REDUCE EMISSIONS UNKNOWNWORD . THE PRESIDENT'S FAILED UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY POLICY IS A PART OF OUR FAILED UNKNOWNWORD FOREIGN POLICY . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD US OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD WE NEED TO SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS . I'LL CHANGE THAT BY LEADING THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP A NEW TREATY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS SET TO UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . ONE OF THE WORST UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENT SENT WAS WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HE COULD HAVE SAID WE DON'T LIKE UNKNOWNWORD BUT WE'RE IMMEDIATELY STARTING A NEW PROCESS . BUT THAT DIDN'T UNKNOWNWORD . WELL , COME JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD , I'M SENDING A DIFFERENT MESSAGE . I WANT TO ACT QUICKLY TO HELP DEVELOP A NEW TREATY . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN HIGH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD EVERY THREE MONTHS , IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT A NEW UNKNOWNWORD . MY UNKNOWNWORD WILL BE TO SECURE A DEAL BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD FOR TWO MORE YEARS . I WILL ESTABLISH AN UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD WHICH IS WHERE THE BIG UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIES COME TOGETHER . WE NEED THE WORLD'S MAJOR UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS TO COME TOGETHER TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES . I WANT TO FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE LOSING OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THEY UNKNOWNWORD SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN UNKNOWNWORD CARBON UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY FOR THAT . WE'VE SEEN HOW GOOD LEADERSHIP CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOLVING GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS . FORMER PRIME MINISTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNDERSTOOD THE URGENCY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CALLED A MEETING IN UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS A DRIVING FORCE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WILL HAVE A ROLE TO UNKNOWNWORD . EVERYWHERE I GO , I MEET PEOPLE , AND PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN , WHO ASK ME WHAT THEY CAN DO TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING . WHAT THEY CAN DO TO BE MORE ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , I ALWAYS TELL THEM ABOUT MY LATE FATHER WHO UNKNOWNWORD OFF EVERY LIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT ANY UNKNOWNWORD AND HE USED TO TURN OFF THE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN WE WENT TO UNKNOWNWORD AT NIGHT . AS HE USED TO SAY , 'I'M NOT PAYING TO UNKNOWNWORD THE HOUSE , SO GET MORE COVERS .' THAT UNKNOWNWORD KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD , BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR PARENTS AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD USED TO DO . WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE UNKNOWNWORD OF HOW WE LIVE TODAY . ON UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN GREATER UNKNOWNWORD THE WAYS INDIVIDUALS , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , SCHOOLS , ALL OF US CAN UNKNOWNWORD OUR ROLE . IT STARTS BY ASKING EVERY AMERICAN WHO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A PLEDGE TO DO SO TO REDUCE YOUR PERSONAL UNKNOWNWORD TO GLOBAL WARMING -- ENCOURAGE YOUR NEIGHBORS TO DO THE SAME . IF EVERY HOME REPLACED - THIS IS UNKNOWNWORD AND I KEPT SAYING ARE YOU SURE THIS IS TRUE , LISTEN TO THIS - IF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR HOMES REPLACED JUST ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD WITH ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT WOULD SAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO LIGHT MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD MILLION HOMES AND PREVENT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD CARS IN A YEAR . SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WELL WE'VE GOT TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE GOVERNMENT , WE GOT TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR GREAT COMPANIES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD , THAT'S NOT TRUE . THERE'S SOMETHING EVERY ONE OF US CAN DO . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES TO SET THEIR OWN ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD GOALS . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE SCHOOLS , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD AND STUDENTS TO DO THE SAME . AND GIVE UNKNOWNWORD SO WE CAN REALLY HOLD UP THE BEST LEADERS . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE UNKNOWNWORD TO DO THE SAME AS WELL . WE'RE GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD IN NEW MANAGEMENT TOOLS SO THAT UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD CAN KEEP UNKNOWNWORD OF WHAT THEY UNKNOWNWORD AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THE UNITED STATES UNKNOWNWORD WILL ISSUE UNKNOWNWORD INDEPENDENCE UNKNOWNWORD " DEDICATED TO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND . DURING WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR UNKNOWNWORD . MORE THAN 6 MILLION AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE CAN APPEAL TO THAT SAME SENSE OF DUTY AND PATRIOTISM TODAY . AS UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT GORE SAYS , POLITICAL WILL IS A RENEWABLE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , I AM UNKNOWNWORD MORE THAN A PLAN . I HAVE A STRATEGY TO MAKE THIS REAL . I HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN NOT TO JUST TO MAKE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO DO , BUT TO TELL YOU HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT AND HOW I WILL DO IT . ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FACING THOSE COUNTRIES THAT DID UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS TURNING GOOD INTENTIONS INTO UNKNOWNWORD , ECONOMICALLY UNKNOWNWORD RESULTS . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CREATE A NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL , UNKNOWNWORD ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL , TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PRIORITIES AND WE FOLLOW A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PLAN . FOR EXAMPLE , THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT WILL WORK MORE UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT ON GOOD UNKNOWNWORD FOR SCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD . THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT WILL WORK MORE UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE COUNCIL WILL BE LED BY A NATIONAL ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD WITH A DIRECT LINE TO THE PRESIDENT TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD EFFORTS AND MAINTAIN UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ALSO REFORM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY . THIS ENERGY TODAY IS FOCUSED UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD FUELS AND NUCLEAR POWER , WITH MUCH LESS ATTENTION TO UNKNOWNWORD LIKE WIND . I WILL FOCUS THE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON MOVING US TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE , WITH A NEW UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD AND WIND AND BIOFUELS AND UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHALLENGE FOR OUR NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT . I WILL START MEETING IT ON DAY ONE . IN ONE OF AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD HOURS - SOON AFTER THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR , LONG BEFORE VICTORY WAS UNKNOWNWORD - PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ADDRESSED THE NATION IN ONE OF HIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE PRESIDENT DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD WORDS . HE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND IN GREAT UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF THE THREATS WE FACED . HE EVEN ASKED AMERICANS TO TAKE OUT A MAP OF THE WORLD SO THEY COULD FOLLOW UNKNOWNWORD WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT . THE PRESIDENT SAID , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE AMERICANS NOW FACE WILL TEST US TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE BEEN CALLED UPON FOR SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT . NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE HAD SO LITTLE TIME IN WHICH TO DO SO MUCH .' AMERICANS WERE UP TO THAT UNKNOWNWORD . WHILE YOUNG BRAVE TROOPS SERVED , AND UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OVERSEAS , HERE AT HOME AMERICANS DID THEIR PART . MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO WORK IN FACTORIES TO BUILD SHIPS AND UNKNOWNWORD . AMERICANS GREW VICTORY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WAR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD FUEL AND ELECTRICITY . THE UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE US UNKNOWNWORD THE SAME URGENCY AND DEMANDS THE SAME RESOLVE . UNKNOWNWORD THE ENERGY CRISIS IS THE CALLING OF OUR TIME . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , IT WILL BE THE CALLING OF OUR NATION . AND IT WILL UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US . AND JUST AS THE UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION UNKNOWNWORD TO THE OCCASION , I BELIEVE THE UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION WILL DO THE SAME . [APPLAUSE ] IN MY CAMPAIGN , I HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE FOUR BIG GOALS FOR OUR COUNTRY : RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD , REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS , REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . MEETING THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGE IS UNKNOWNWORD TO REACHING EVERY ONE OF THOSE . I DO NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION TO LEAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD IN WORSE UNKNOWNWORD THAN WHEN WE FOUND THEM . IT WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD ON MY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO BE IN THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AGAIN , IF YOU WANT TO END THE UNKNOWNWORD PARTISANSHIP , IF YOU WANT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER -- JOIN WITH ME IN UNKNOWNWORD ONE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGES WE'VE EVER FACED . IT WILL BE AN UNKNOWNWORD , NOBLE , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , TAKING US TO PLACES WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE TODAY . JUST LIKE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD SHIPS UNKNOWNWORD UP THE WORLD TO AMERICA , WE'RE GOING OPEN UP THE FUTURE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . AND IF WE DO IT RIGHT THEY WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE ON THIS MOMENT WHEN AMERICANS CAME TOGETHER TO TURN A THREAT TO OUR FUTURE INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS NEW CENTURY . 
BLUE	LET ME START BY UNKNOWNWORD A GREAT AMERICAN , AL GORE , FOR BEING UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD WINNER OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE . UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT GORE HAS BEEN AN UNKNOWNWORD LEADER FOR THIS COUNTRY . THROUGH HIS MANY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE ; HIS EARLY AND UNKNOWNWORD OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IN IRAQ ; AND -- ABOVE ALL -- HIS UNKNOWNWORD LEADERSHIP IN UNKNOWNWORD ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS , AL GORE HAS ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF PEACE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . THIS AWARD IS UNKNOWNWORD DESERVED . YOU KNOW , IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO YESTERDAY THAT THE UNITED STATES SENATE VOTED TO GIVE PRESIDENT BUSH THE AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR IN IRAQ . AT THE TIME , I WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S . SENATE AND I UNKNOWNWORD OUT UNKNOWNWORD IN OPPOSITION TO GOING TO WAR . NEARLY ALL OF MY OPPONENTS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE , AND VOTED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE WAR . NOW , SOME HAVE ASKED ME , "WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD US THAT YOU OPPOSED THE WAR ? ISN'T THAT UNKNOWNWORD NEWS ? IS THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY UNKNOWNWORD ?" AND WHAT I ALWAYS SAY IS THIS -- THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE PAST , IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE . I DON'T TALK ABOUT MY OPPOSITION TO THE WAR TO SAY UNKNOWNWORD TOLD YOU SO ." I UNKNOWNWORD THE WAR HAD GONE DIFFERENTLY . BUT THE REASON I TALK ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE I UNKNOWNWORD BELIEVE THAT THE JUDGMENT , AND THE CONVICTION , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT EACH OF US UNKNOWNWORD ON THE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY DECISION OF OUR LIVES IS THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD YOU HAVE OF HOW EACH OF US WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD . HOW WE MADE THAT DECISION , AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT , IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT . WILL WE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTION , OR WILL WE UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE INTELLIGENCE AND UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNKNOWNWORD ? WILL WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS BASED ON POLLS , OR BASED ON OUR PRINCIPLES ? WILL WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICE , OR WILL WE JUST CHOOSE THE COURSE THAT MAKES US LOOK TOUGH ? THESE DECISIONS AREN'T JUST WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD GAMES ABOUT WHO'S UP AND WHO'S DOWN . THESE ARE LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS . THEY IMPACT YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND SECURITY . ABOVE ALL , THEY IMPACT THE SOLDIER FROM IOWA , OR THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM ILLINOIS , AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR BRAVE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN HARM'S WAY , AND ALL OF THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS BACK HOME . NOW , IT'S EASY TO OPPOSE A WAR AFTER IT HAS GONE UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S EASY TO SAY -- YEARS LATER -- THAT THE WAR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE HAPPENED , GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT HOW UNKNOWNWORD IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD OUT . BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ONLY HAD ONE CHANCE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO WAR . AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY , SO MANY AMERICANS ASK ME : HOW DID WE GO SO UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ ? AND THEY'RE NOT JUST ASKING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PAST -- THEY'RE ASKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR LEADERS TO MAKE THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN IN THE FUTURE . THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD US DOWN IN UNKNOWNWORD WARS ; THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO ALLOW AMERICA TO LOSE ITS STANDING ; AND THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ANYTHING LESS THAN THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND AND WHAT UNKNOWNWORD DO . THAT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT . BECAUSE WE NEED TO LEARN THE UNKNOWNWORD LESSONS OF THE IRAQ WAR IF WE'RE GOING TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY AND UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP . THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ . BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS . THE FIRST WAY IS TO SAY THAT IRAQ IS A UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OF GEORGE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . OR BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND INCOMPETENCE OF UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY OR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD THE WAR . OR BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD PRIME MINISTER JUST HASN'T BEEN UP TO THE JOB . BUT I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW . I THINK THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST HOW WE'VE FOUGHT THE WAR -- IT'S THAT WE FOUGHT THE WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE . BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS , THE WAR IN IRAQ SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD , AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WAGED . THE IRAQ WAR HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AL QAEDA OR 9/11 . IT WAS BASED ON UNKNOWNWORD FEARS AND UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE . AND IT HAS LEFT AMERICA LESS SAFE , AND LESS RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD . FIVE YEARS AGO , MY FRIENDS UNKNOWNWORD ME NOT TO SPEAK UP AGAINST THE WAR . GOING TO WAR WAS POPULAR . SO WAS PRESIDENT BUSH . YOU'LL BE PUTTING YOUR POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD ON THE LINE , THEY SAID . BUT I JUST DIDN'T SEE HOW SADDAM HUSSEIN POSED AN IMMINENT THREAT . I WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT A WAR WOULD DISTRACT US FROM AFGHANISTAN AND AL QAEDA , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE FLAMES OF EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM . AND I DIDN'T GET INTO POLITICS TO STAY UNKNOWNWORD ON THE TOUGH ISSUES , OR TO TAILOR MY POSITIONS TO THE POLLS . I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK BACK , AFTER AN UNKNOWNWORD WAR HAD BEEN WAGED , AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT I DIDN'T SPEAK OUT AGAINST GOING TO WAR JUST BECAUSE GOING TO WAR WAS POPULAR . SO I UNKNOWNWORD OUT AGAINST WHAT I CALLED A UNKNOWNWORD WAR " -- A UNKNOWNWORD BASED NOT ON REASON BUT ON POLITICS ." BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING IN WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD UP FOR WAR . THE PRESIDENT AND HIS UNKNOWNWORD TOLD US THAT THE ONLY WAY TO STOP SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON WAS TO GO TO WAR , THAT WE COULDN'T LET THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . LEADING DEMOCRATS -- INCLUDING SENATOR CLINTON -- UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD LINE THAT THERE WAS A UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA . WE WERE UNKNOWNWORD BY SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED VOICES IN WASHINGTON THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO LOOK TOUGH WAS TO TALK , ACT , AND VOTE LIKE REPUBLICANS . THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH FAILED US IN THE UNKNOWNWORD TO WAR . BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST FAILED BY THE PRESIDENT -- THEY WERE FAILED BY THE CONGRESS . TOO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FAILED TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS . TOO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , INCLUDING SOME OF MY OPPONENTS IN THIS RACE , FAILED TO READ THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEMSELVES -- AN INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT WAS SO UNKNOWNWORD , AND SO UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD , THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE UNKNOWNWORD DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR WHEN HE READ IT FOR UNKNOWNWORD . TOO MANY DEMOCRATS UNKNOWNWORD IN LINE WITH GEORGE BUSH , AND VOTED TO GIVE HIM THE UNKNOWNWORD AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR THAT HE USES TO THIS DAY . SO LET'S BE CLEAR : WITHOUT THAT VOTE , THERE WOULD BE NO WAR . SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD VOTED FOR THE WAR IN UNKNOWNWORD . HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT VOTE , INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT WAS A VOTE FOR ANYTHING BUT WAR . BUT SENATOR CLINTON MAKES A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD . SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T REALLY VOTING FOR WAR BACK IN UNKNOWNWORD , SHE WAS VOTING FOR MORE UNKNOWNWORD , OR SHE WAS VOTING FOR MORE DIPLOMACY . BUT ALL OF US KNOW WHAT WAS BEING UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CONGRESS IN THE FALL OF UNKNOWNWORD . WE DIDN'T NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD A WAR IN ORDER TO HAVE UNITED NATIONS WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD . NO ONE THOUGHT CONGRESS WAS UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER OR NOT TO UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY . THE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD 12 , UNKNOWNWORD DID NOT READ : UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY WITH IRAQ " -- THE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD 12 , UNKNOWNWORD READ UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAR ." IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , WE UNKNOWNWORD JUST SEEN DIFFERENT CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THEIR VOTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS -- WE'VE SEEN HOW DIFFERENT CANDIDATES HAVE DRAWN DIFFERENT LESSONS FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE IRAQ WAR . FIVE YEARS LATER , WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSONS OF THAT VOTE -- WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN'T GIVE THIS ADMINISTRATION AN UNKNOWNWORD TO WAGE WAR . BUT JUST LAST MONTH , THE SENATE VOTED FOR AN UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE RISK THAT WE COULD UNKNOWNWORD THE MISTAKE OF IRAQ . HERE IS WHY THIS UNKNOWNWORD IS SO UNKNOWNWORD . IT OPENS WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD IRAN'S INFLUENCE INSIDE OF IRAQ . THEN IT SAYS WE HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD INSIDE IRAQ TO UNKNOWNWORD IRAN . IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT IT IS UNKNOWNWORD CRITICAL NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES " TO PREVENT THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT FROM UNKNOWNWORD INFLUENCE INSIDE IRAQ . WHY IS THIS UNKNOWNWORD SO DANGEROUS ? BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH AND UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY COULD USE THIS UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD KEEPING OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ AS LONG AS THEY CAN POINT TO A THREAT FROM IRAN . AND BECAUSE THEY COULD USE THIS UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD AN ATTACK ON IRAN AS A PART OF THE UNKNOWNWORD WAR IN IRAQ . I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS PRESIDENT ANY UNKNOWNWORD , OR ANY OPENING FOR WAR . BECAUSE AS WE LEARNED WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQ WAR -- WHEN YOU GIVE THIS PRESIDENT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , YOU CAN'T BE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN HE UNKNOWNWORD IT . SENATOR CLINTON IS THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD . SHE SAID , LIKE SHE DID FIVE YEARS AGO , THAT IT IS A WAY TO SUPPORT DIPLOMACY . I UNKNOWNWORD . WE ALL KNOW THAT IRAN POSES A THREAT . WE DO NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO STOP IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM . WE DO NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD SANCTIONS ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD -- PARTICULARLY ON IRAN'S UNKNOWNWORD GUARD , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD TERRORISM . BUT THIS MUST BE DONE UNKNOWNWORD FROM ANY UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD INFLUENCE WITH OUR MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ . WE SHOULD NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR TROOPS HAVE TO STAY IN IRAQ TO UNKNOWNWORD IRAN . NOW IS THE TIME TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ . NOW IS THE TIME TO START BRINGING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ -- IMMEDIATELY . THAT'S WHY I HAVE A PLAN TO UNKNOWNWORD ONE OR TWO COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD A MONTH SO THAT WE GET ALL OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ WITHIN UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS -- THAT'S AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN DO THIS . THE ONLY TROOPS I WILL KEEP IN IRAQ FOR A UNKNOWNWORD TIME WILL PROTECT OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON AL QAEDA -- NOT UNKNOWNWORD COMBAT . AND I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD NEEDED . SO LET THERE BE NO DOUBT : I WILL END THIS WAR . NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GIVE GEORGE BUSH AND UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY ANY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS WAR . NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THE CONGRESS TO SEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY MY POSITION TODAY IS THE SAME AS IT WAS WHEN I STOOD UP IN IOWA ON SEPTEMBER 12 AND SAID : UNKNOWNWORD BUSH AND UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY MUST HEAR -- UNKNOWNWORD AND CLEAR -- FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE CONGRESS : YOU DON'T HAVE OUR SUPPORT , AND YOU DON'T HAVE OUR UNKNOWNWORD FOR ANOTHER WAR ." FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT VOTE FOR WAR , WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSON THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE DOESN'T WORK . WE DO NEED UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN . BUT THE WAY TO SUPPORT TOUGH DIPLOMACY IS NOT TO VOTE FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD -- THE WAY TO SUPPORT DIPLOMACY IS TO ACTUALLY PURSUE IT . THAT'S WHAT I'VE CALLED FOR THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN -- DIRECT DIPLOMACY , WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . NOT THE UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY OF TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR ENEMIES . REAL , DIRECT , AND UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY . A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO , SENATOR CLINTON CALLED ME UNKNOWNWORD AND IRRESPONSIBLE " FOR TAKING THIS POSITION , AND SAID THAT WE COULD LOSE UNKNOWNWORD BATTLES IF WE MET WITH LEADERS WE DIDN'T LIKE . JUST YESTERDAY , THOUGH , SHE CALLED FOR DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD . SO I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF US KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE SHE UNKNOWNWORD ON THIS . BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS : WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I STAND . I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD THE WORLD UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD . I'M NOT UNKNOWNWORD THAT AMERICA WILL LOSE A UNKNOWNWORD BATTLE WITH A PETTY UNKNOWNWORD -- WE NEED TO GO BEFORE THE WORLD AND WIN THOSE BATTLES . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL . YOU KNOW , THE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD THINKING IN WASHINGTON SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS CAN'T TAKE THESE POSITIONS . OR THAT WE NEED TO SAY ONE THING IN A CAUCUS AND PRIMARY CAMPAIGN , BUT ANOTHER IN A UNKNOWNWORD ELECTION . THIS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT SAID THAT DEMOCRATS HAD TO VOTE FOR WAR IN UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ELECTION COMING UP -- AN ELECTION THAT WE LOST . THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS CAN'T WIN ELECTIONS , UNKNOWNWORD THEY TALK , ACT AND VOTE LIKE REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY . WELL , I'M NOT RUNNING TO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THINKING -- I'M RUNNING TO CHALLENGE IT . THAT'S WHAT I DID IN UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHAT I DID IN UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . BECAUSE I THINK THE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE IT UNKNOWNWORD . I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO LOOK TOUGH , WHO SAY ONE THING IN A CAUCUS AND ANOTHER IN A UNKNOWNWORD ELECTION . WHEN I AM THE NOMINEE OF OUR PARTY , THE CHOICE WILL BE CLEAR . MY REPUBLICAN OPPONENT WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE BOTH SUPPORTED THIS WAR IN IRAQ . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE REALLY AGREE ABOUT USING THE WAR IN IRAQ TO UNKNOWNWORD MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAN , OR ABOUT THE DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING AND UNKNOWNWORD . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I UNKNOWNWORD BEEN OPEN AND STRAIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , OR THAT I'VE CHANGED MY POSITIONS . AND YOU KNOW WHAT ? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THAT CHOICE . BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN OUR NEXT PRESIDENT . WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF A MISGUIDED WAR IN IRAQ THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUGHT -- A WAR THAT NEEDS TO END . WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO PUT TOUGH TALK AHEAD OF REAL DIPLOMACY . AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO PUT POWER OVER PRINCIPLE , OF A GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON THAT UNKNOWNWORD YOU OUT , AND OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO DON'T HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE . THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE STAND FOR AS DEMOCRATS . BUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT -- IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE STAND FOR AS AMERICANS . BECAUSE THERE ARE UNKNOWNWORD OF DEMOCRATS AND UNKNOWNWORD OF INDEPENDENTS AND , YES , UNKNOWNWORD OF REPUBLICANS OUT THERE WHO ARE READY TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS AND UNKNOWNWORD FOREIGN POLICY COMING FROM WASHINGTON . THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER . THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE OUR SECURITY AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD . NOT BY UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD , BUT BY STANDING STRONG IN ANY STORM , AND STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE . I WOULD NOT BE ON THIS UNKNOWNWORD TODAY IF THE PROMISE OF AMERICA HAD NOT BROUGHT MY FATHER ACROSS AN OCEAN . I WOULD NOT BE ON THIS UNKNOWNWORD IF GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAD NOT FOUGHT BEFORE ME SO THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM COULD BE EXTENDED TO A MAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OBAMA . THAT'S WHY I HAVE SPENT MY OWN LIFE FIGHTING FOR THAT DREAM , NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN , NO MATTER HOW TOUGH IT WAS TO TAKE A STAND . THAT'S WHY I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU WHERE I STAND AND WHAT I BELIEVE . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THAT IS HOW WE WILL MEET THE HARD CHALLENGES , AND RECLAIM THAT DREAM , AND MAKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A LIGHT TO THE WORLD ONCE MORE . 
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD TWO WEEKS AGO , UNKNOWNWORD FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF GREENHOUSE GASES WERE UNKNOWNWORD TO WASHINGTON BY THE PRESIDENT FOR A GLOBAL UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE . FOR A UNKNOWNWORD MOMENT , THERE WAS A HOPE THAT MAYBE THIS UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE DIFFERENT - THAT MAYBE AMERICA WOULD FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT NEARLY EVERY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BELIEVES WE MUST TAKE ; THAT MAYBE THE UNKNOWNWORD ONLY SUPERPOWER WOULD FINALLY LEAD THE WORLD - OR AT THE VERY LEAST , FOLLOW IT - IN TAKING ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THREAT . INSTEAD , THE WORLD TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES TO WASHINGTON ONLY TO FIND THAT WASHINGTON IS STILL MILES AWAY FROM THE WORLD IN ITS WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT CHALLENGES OF OUR GENERATION . SOME OF THE UNKNOWNWORD SAID THEY WERE UNKNOWNWORD AT HOW UNKNOWNWORD THE WHITE HOUSE VIEW HAD BECOME . OTHERS UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENT'S UNKNOWNWORD ENTIRELY . AND ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE GLOBAL UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE , OUR COUNTRY IS UNKNOWNWORD JUST TO STAY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD JUST TO STAY UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE KNOW . IT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN . WE ARE A NATION THAT HAS LED THE WORLD EVER SINCE THE MOMENT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT FREEDOM COULD UNKNOWNWORD OVER UNKNOWNWORD . WE ARE THE COUNTRY THAT SUMMONED THE COURAGE OF ITS PEOPLE TO BUILD AN ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY THAT UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND BROUGHT PEACE TO A WORLD AT WAR . WE ARE A LAND OF MOON UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE LIVES OF MILLIONS ACROSS THE PLANET . AND WHEN THAT PLANET IS UNKNOWNWORD OR WHEN IT IS THREATENED , THE EYES OF THE WORLD HAVE ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD TO THIS NATION AS THE UNKNOWNWORD , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ." THAT IS THE AMERICA I WANT TO LEAD AS PRESIDENT . I BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE THAT WILL DETERMINE THE VERY FUTURE OF LIFE ON THIS EARTH , WE ARE STILL EARTH'S BEST HOPE . AND WHEN THE WORLD UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO HEAR WHAT AMERICA HAS TO SAY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE , I WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT AMERICA IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE . THAT AMERICA IS READY TO LEAD AGAIN . WE HAVE NOT UNKNOWNWORD BEHIND ON ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD TO A LACK OF INGENUITY OR UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH INNOVATION AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS COUNTRY TO BELIEVE THAT . RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , I'VE UNKNOWNWORD UP AT A BIODIESEL UNKNOWNWORD AT UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE THIS YEAR STUDENTS AND UNKNOWNWORD WILL UNKNOWNWORD OVER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF CARBON UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE ATMOSPHERE . NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ALREADY REDUCING ITS GREENHOUSE GAS UNKNOWNWORD AS PART OF THE UNKNOWNWORD GREENHOUSE GAS UNKNOWNWORD , AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , YOU'LL GET 25 % OF YOUR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IS ONE OF AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND I UNDERSTAND THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE NOW PASSED A UNKNOWNWORD DEMANDING THAT WASHINGTON TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WASHINGTON HASN'T UNKNOWNWORD ; AND THAT IS THE REAL REASON WHY AMERICA HASN'T LED . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO LEAD ON ENERGY IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A PRESIDENT WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN OFFICE UNKNOWNWORD THE VERY UNKNOWNWORD OF GLOBAL WARMING - A PRESIDENT WHO PUT MORE FAITH IN THE SPIN OF A SCIENCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAN THE SCIENCE UNKNOWNWORD OF REAL EXPERTS . IT'S THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT DEVELOPED AMERICA'S ENERGY POLICY WITH A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FORCE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE DOOR TO OIL LOBBYISTS AND THEN SHUT IT TO EVERY OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD OF LEADERSHIP THAT HAS NEVER CALLED ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN GO UNKNOWNWORD . AND IT'S ALSO A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR POLITICS THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENCY OF GEORGE W . BUSH . WE HAVE HEARD PROMISES ABOUT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FROM EVERY SINGLE U.S . PRESIDENT SINCE RICHARD NIXON - REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS . WE'VE HEARD PROPOSALS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR USE OF FOSSIL FUELS IN NEARLY EVERY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS SINCE THE OIL UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BACK THEN WE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR OIL . NOW WE UNKNOWNWORD OVER HALF . BACK THEN GLOBAL WARMING WAS JUST THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A FEW SCIENTISTS . NOW IT IS A FACT THAT THREATENS OUR VERY UNKNOWNWORD . THE TRUTH IS , OUR ENERGY PROBLEM HAS BECOME AN ENERGY CRISIS BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW UNKNOWNWORD THE PROMISE - NO MATTER HOW BOLD THE PROPOSAL - THEY ALL FALL UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SAME WASHINGTON POLITICS THAT HAS ONLY BECOME MORE DIVIDED AND UNKNOWNWORD ; MORE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST STAKE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE SOME IN THIS RACE WHO ACTUALLY MAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS OF WASHINGTON , THE MORE UNKNOWNWORD YOU ARE TO CHANGE IT . I ALWAYS FIND THIS A LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD . I KNOW THAT CHANGE MAKES FOR GOOD CAMPAIGN UNKNOWNWORD , BUT WHEN THESE SAME PEOPLE HAD THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY MAKE CHANGE UNKNOWNWORD , THEY DIDN'T LEAD . WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO STAND UP AND REQUIRE AUTOMAKERS TO RAISE THEIR FUEL STANDARDS , THEY REFUSED . WHEN THEY HAD UNKNOWNWORD CHANCES TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL BY INVESTING IN RENEWABLE FUELS THAT WE CAN LITERALLY GROW RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA , THEY SAID NO . NOW , I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE DIFFICULT POLITICALLY . THEY AREN'T EASY . BUT BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ISN'T ABOUT DOING WHAT'S EASY . IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S HARD . IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT . LEADERSHIP ISN'T ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR - IT'S ABOUT TELLING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR . WHEN I UNKNOWNWORD IN THE U.S . SENATE , I WANTED TO DO UNKNOWNWORD I COULD TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . I REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO PASS A LAW THAT WILL GIVE MORE AMERICANS THE CHANCE TO FILL UP THEIR CARS WITH CLEAN BIOFUELS . I PASSED A LAW THAT WILL FUEL THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP A CAR THAT WILL GET UNKNOWNWORD MILES TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . I EVEN VOTED FOR AN ENERGY BILL THAT WAS FAR FROM UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT CONTAINED SOME REAL UNKNOWNWORD IN RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY . AND I'VE FOUGHT TO UNKNOWNWORD THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO OIL COMPANIES THAT WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO THAT BILL - OIL COMPANIES THAT HAVE SPENT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS UNKNOWNWORD CONGRESS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WHILE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO RECORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND I DID SOMETHING ELSE . I KNEW THAT AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD RAISED THE FUEL STANDARDS FOR OUR CARS IN TWENTY YEARS . EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE UNKNOWNWORD . EVEN THOUGH UNKNOWNWORD CAR COMPANIES THAT MAKE MORE UNKNOWNWORD CARS ARE RUNNING UNKNOWNWORD AROUND OUR OWN CAR COMPANIES . EVEN THOUGH WE SEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS REGIMES FOR THEIR OIL . SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW . I REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO RAISE OUR FUEL STANDARDS THAT WON SUPPORT OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAD NEVER SUPPORTED RAISING FUEL STANDARDS BEFORE . AND I DIDN'T JUST GIVE A UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT IT IN FRONT OF SOME ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIENCE IN UNKNOWNWORD . I WENT TO UNKNOWNWORD , I STOOD IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF AUTOMAKERS , AND I TOLD THEM THAT WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL BE NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD - WE WILL HELP THEM UNKNOWNWORD THEIR FACTORIES , BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE CARS THAT USE LESS OIL . NOW I HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD - THE UNKNOWNWORD WAS PRETTY UNKNOWNWORD AFTER THAT . BUT I SAID WHAT I DID BECAUSE I BELIEVE AMERICA HAS HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO JUST TELL EVERYONE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR . WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH . AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THE SAME OLD POLITICS STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR FUTURE ANYMORE . WE CAN'T AFFORD THE SAME KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR SECURITY IS AT STAKE . WE KNOW THAT THE MONEY THAT AMERICA SPENDS ON FOREIGN OIL IS FUNDING BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR ON TERROR ; THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD FOR EVERYTHING FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT PLANT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TERROR IN YOUNG MINDS TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT ATTACK OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ . WE KNOW THIS MONEY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND ALLOWS DICTATORS FROM UNKNOWNWORD REGIMES TO THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY . IT EVEN UNKNOWNWORD A TARGET FOR UNKNOWNWORD BIN LADEN , WHO HAS TOLD AL QAEDA TO , UNKNOWNWORD YOUR UNKNOWNWORD ON OIL , SINCE THIS WILL CAUSE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS ] TO UNKNOWNWORD OFF ON THEIR OWN ." WE CAN'T BE UNKNOWNWORD TO STAND UP TO THE OIL AND AUTO INDUSTRY WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY IS AT STAKE . WHEN WE LET THESE COMPANIES OFF THE UNKNOWNWORD ; WHEN WE TELL THEM THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUILD UNKNOWNWORD CARS OR UNKNOWNWORD TO RENEWABLE FUELS , IT MAY UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IT IS KILLING THEIR LONG-TERM CHANCES FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TOO MANY AMERICAN JOBS . THE GLOBAL MARKET IS ALREADY MOVING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS . THE QUESTION IS NOT IF A RENEWABLE ENERGY ECONOMY WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FUTURE , IT'S WHERE . AND IF WE WANT THAT PLACE TO BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , WE CAN'T AFFORD TO UNKNOWNWORD ANY LONGER . MOST OF ALL , WE CANNOT AFFORD MORE OF THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET IS AT STAKE . GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT A SOMEDAY PROBLEM , IT IS NOW . IN A STATE LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE , THE UNKNOWNWORD INDUSTRY IS FACING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND LOSING JOBS . WE ARE ALREADY BREAKING RECORDS WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD , THE NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD COULD FORCE MORE THAN 250 MILLION FROM THEIR HOMES - UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES OF WAR AND UNKNOWNWORD IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD STATES . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAN SCIENCE HAD EVER UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF WE DO NOTHING , UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS WILL RISE HIGH ENOUGH TO UNKNOWNWORD LARGE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVERY UNKNOWNWORD CITY AND TOWN . THIS IS NOT THE FUTURE I WANT FOR MY DAUGHTERS . IT'S NOT THE FUTURE ANY OF US WANT FOR OUR CHILDREN . AND IF WE ACT NOW AND WE ACT UNKNOWNWORD , IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE . BUT IF WE UNKNOWNWORD ; IF WE LET CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND STATE OF THE UNION UNKNOWNWORD GO UNKNOWNWORD FOR YET ANOTHER YEAR ; IF WE LET THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS THAT'S HELD US BACK FOR DECADES WIN ONE MORE TIME , WE WILL LOSE ANOTHER CHANCE TO SAVE OUR PLANET . AND WE MIGHT NOT GET MANY MORE . I REJECT THAT FUTURE . I WOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS TIME COULD BE DIFFERENT . NOT BECAUSE I HAVE SOME UNKNOWNWORD SOLUTION THAT EVERY OTHER UNKNOWNWORD AND CANDIDATE HAS SOMEHOW UNKNOWNWORD . NOT BECAUSE I THINK I CAN UNKNOWNWORD MYSELF IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FORCE AND GET THIS DONE ON MY OWN . BUT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR A PRESIDENT WHO CAN UNKNOWNWORD US AROUND A COMMON PURPOSE AGAIN . I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO LEAD AGAIN . MAKE NO MISTAKE - DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENERGY WILL BE ONE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGES THAT THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS WILL EVER FACE . IT WILL NOT BE EASY . IT WILL NOT COME WITHOUT COST OR WITHOUT SACRIFICE . AND IF ANYONE TRIES TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE , THEY ARE EITHER UNKNOWNWORD THEMSELVES OR TRYING TO UNKNOWNWORD YOU . I WILL SET BIG GOALS FOR THIS COUNTRY AS PRESIDENT - SOME SO LARGE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY TO REACH THEM DOES NOT YET UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THAT HAS NOT STOPPED US BEFORE . WHEN PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HIM THAT HIS GOALS FOR UNKNOWNWORD PRODUCTION WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET , HE UNKNOWNWORD THEM OFF AND SAID UNKNOWNWORD ME , THE PRODUCTION PEOPLE CAN DO IT IF THEY REALLY TRY ." AND THEY DID . WHEN THE SCIENTISTS AND UNKNOWNWORD TOLD UNKNOWNWORD F . KENNEDY THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON , HE TOLD THEM THEY WOULD FIND A WAY . AND WE FOUND ONE . I BELIEVE WE WILL AGAIN . IN THE UNKNOWNWORD I GAVE IN UNKNOWNWORD , I UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE FIRST PART OF MY COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN - A PROPOSAL THAT WILL REQUIRE OUR CARS TO USE LESS OIL AND OUR FUELS TO USE LESS CARBON . IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT ALONE UNKNOWNWORD 50 MILLION CARS ' UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE ROAD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR OIL CONSUMPTION UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD A DAY BY UNKNOWNWORD - THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL THE OIL WE UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . TODAY I WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE SECOND PART OF MY PLAN - A SET OF PROPOSALS THAT WILL ALLOW AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD IN COMBATING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE . FROM THE MOMENT I TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CALL TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS ; UNKNOWNWORD OF INDUSTRY AND LABOR ; DEMOCRATS , REPUBLICANS AND AMERICANS FROM ALL UNKNOWNWORD OF LIFE TO HELP DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENERGY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD THE NEXT UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY . AFTER ALL , IN MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF UNKNOWNWORD GENERATIONS , WE DIDN'T JUST END A UNKNOWNWORD WAR OR UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE MOON - WE ALSO UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD NEVER UNKNOWNWORD OF . THE UNKNOWNWORD BILL SENT AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF AMERICANS - INCLUDING MY GRANDFATHER - TO COLLEGE AND THEN ON TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD OF SCIENTISTS AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM OUR RACE TO SPACE WHOSE UNKNOWNWORD AND INNOVATIONS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD CHANGED THE WORLD . THIS SAME OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TODAY . THAT'S WHY MY PLAN ISN'T JUST ABOUT MAKING UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY EXPENSIVE , IT'S ABOUT MAKING CLEAN ENERGY AFFORDABLE - A PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA . THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD IN DOING THIS IS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT A UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD OUR CHANGING CLIMATE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL SET A HARD UNKNOWNWORD ON ALL CARBON EMISSIONS AT A UNKNOWNWORD THAT SCIENTISTS SAY IS NECESSARY TO UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL WARMING - AN 80 % UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS ISN'T JUST TALK , I WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD THIS UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . THESE UNKNOWNWORD WILL START IMMEDIATELY , AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TOP SCIENTISTS TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR UNKNOWNWORD ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHALLENGE WE FACE . IN ADDITION TO THIS UNKNOWNWORD , ALL UNKNOWNWORD WILL HAVE TO PAY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF UNKNOWNWORD THEY UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD . THE MARKET WILL SET THE UNKNOWNWORD , BUT UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED IN THIS RACE , NO BUSINESS WILL BE ALLOWED TO UNKNOWNWORD ANY UNKNOWNWORD GASES FOR FREE . BUSINESSES DON'T OWN THE UNKNOWNWORD , THE PUBLIC DOES , AND IF WE WANT THEM TO STOP UNKNOWNWORD IT , WE HAVE TO PUT A UNKNOWNWORD ON ALL UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE CLEANER WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THE MORE UNKNOWNWORD WAY OF DOING BUSINESS . THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS UNKNOWNWORD WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . TO MAKE IT EASIER , WE WILL PROVIDE UNKNOWNWORD TO AMERICANS WHO NEED HELP WITH THEIR ENERGY BILLS . WE'LL HELP FAMILIES MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT , AND WE'LL HELP WORKERS AND FACTORIES UNKNOWNWORD THEIR FACILITIES SO THEY CAN COMPETE AND UNKNOWNWORD IN A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY . AND ONCE WE MAKE AMERICA MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND START UNKNOWNWORD MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY , WE WILL SAVE MONEY AND BRING ENERGY COSTS DOWN IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE MUST ACT NOW . ONCE WE MAKE UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY EXPENSIVE , THE SECOND UNKNOWNWORD IN MY PLAN IS TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO UNKNOWNWORD THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN , AFFORDABLE ENERGY . THAT STARTS WITH THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUELS . WE KNOW THAT CORN UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ALTERNATIVE FUEL WE HAVE EVER DEVELOPED . I'VE BEEN A CHAMPION FOR UNKNOWNWORD . IN JUST TWO YEARS , THE RENEWABLE FUEL UNKNOWNWORD I HELPED PASS HAS UNKNOWNWORD AN HISTORIC UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD PRODUCTION . IT HAS HELPED UNKNOWNWORD FOREIGN OIL AND STRENGTHEN OUR RURAL ECONOMY . AND WE SHOULD FIGHT THE EFFORTS OF BIG OIL AND BIG UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS UNKNOWNWORD INDUSTRY . BUT THE TRUTH IS , CORN UNKNOWNWORD IS NEITHER THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ANSWER TO OUR ENERGY CHALLENGE . THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ECONOMIC AND UNKNOWNWORD CONCERNS ABOUT AN UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND EVEN IF WE DOUBLE OR UNKNOWNWORD ITS PRODUCTION , IT WON'T UNKNOWNWORD EVEN A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR DEMAND FOR GASOLINE . THAT'S WHY WE MUST UNKNOWNWORD IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADVANCED BIOFUELS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT CAN BE MADE FROM THINGS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE BACK IN BUSINESS IF THEY COULD USE UNKNOWNWORD TO PRODUCE BIOFUELS . WE SHOULD SET A UNKNOWNWORD TO PRODUCE THE FIRST TWO BILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF ADVANCED BIOFUELS BY UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MORE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD REFINERIES HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE A PART OF THIS NEW INDUSTRY . WE'LL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD IN CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND POWER AND UNKNOWNWORD POWER , SO THAT BY UNKNOWNWORD , AMERICA CAN MEET A NEW UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL REQUIRE 25 % OF ALL OUR ELECTRICITY TO COME FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES . AND WE MUST FIND A WAY TO STOP COAL FROM UNKNOWNWORD OUR ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR NATION'S MOST ABUNDANT ENERGY SOURCE WILL JUST GO AWAY . IT WON'T . IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE TAKING UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD COAL EMISSIONS ARE UNKNOWNWORD AS WELL . ALREADY , SOME COAL UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IS MAKING ITS WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY WE MUST UNKNOWNWORD IN CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE CAN USE AT HOME AND SHARE WITH THE WORLD . UNTIL THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL RELY ON THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TOOLS ARE NECESSARY TO STOP NEW UNKNOWNWORD COAL UNKNOWNWORD FROM BEING BUILT IN AMERICA - INCLUDING A BAN ON NEW UNKNOWNWORD COAL FACILITIES . WE WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD SAFER WAYS TO USE NUCLEAR POWER , WHICH RIGHT NOW UNKNOWNWORD FOR MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD % OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ELECTRICITY . WE SHOULD ACCELERATE RESEARCH INTO TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE SAFE , SECURE TREATMENT OF NUCLEAR WASTE . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL CONTINUE THE WORK I BEGAN IN THE SENATE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL NUCLEAR MATERIAL IS UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD FOR - BOTH AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . THERE SHOULD BE NO UNKNOWNWORD CUTS OR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - UNKNOWNWORD . MANY OF THESE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES - FROM BIOFUELS TO UNKNOWNWORD POWER TO CARBON UNKNOWNWORD - ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN RESEARCH UNKNOWNWORD AND FACILITIES ALL ACROSS AMERICA AT THIS VERY MOMENT . THE PROBLEM IS THEY MIGHT NEVER GET FURTHER THAN THAT . U.S . VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING DOES A GREAT JOB INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT , BUT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RISK OUT OF BRINGING NEW UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD MARKETPLACE . AND SO WE SEE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN AMERICA - LIKE WIND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - DEVELOPED OVERSEAS AND THEN UNKNOWNWORD BACK TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS . THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD A CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES VENTURE CAPITAL FUND THAT WILL PROVIDE $10 BILLION A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS TO GET THE MOST PROMISING CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OFF THE GROUND . THIS VENTURE CAPITAL FUND WILL GET NEW TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE MARKETPLACE SO THAT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CAN BENEFIT FROM AMERICA'S INNOVATIONS . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN MY PLAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS TO CALL ON BUSINESSES , GOVERNMENT , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO MAKE AMERICA 50 % MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT BY UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS BY FAR THE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR EMISSIONS AND SAVE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME . SINCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE COMPANY HAS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD AND CUT ITS ENERGY BILLS BY UNKNOWNWORD BILLION , AND UNKNOWNWORD LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD HAVE LED IN MEETING NEW EFFICIENCY STANDARDS . THERE IS NO REASON THE REST OF AMERICA CAN'T DO THE SAME . WE WILL START BY UNKNOWNWORD IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY HALF OF ALL CARBON EMISSIONS IN AMERICA TODAY . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE'LL SET A UNKNOWNWORD OF MAKING OUR NEW UNKNOWNWORD 50 % MORE EFFICIENT WITHIN UNKNOWNWORD YEARS . THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL LEAD BY MAKING ALL OF ITS UNKNOWNWORD CARBON UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . AND I WILL SET A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD OF MAKING ALL NEW UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA CARBON UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE WILL ALSO START UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD POWER UNKNOWNWORD WITH A UNKNOWNWORD SMART UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LIKE WE DID IN THE UNKNOWNWORD NEW YORK CITY UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL FOLLOW THE LEAD OF STATES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND CHANGE THE WAY UTILITIES MAKE MONEY SO THAT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AREN'T UNKNOWNWORD TO HOW MUCH ENERGY WE USE , BUT HOW MUCH ENERGY WE SAVE . FINALLY , WE KNOW THAT IF EVERY HOME IN AMERICA REPLACED JUST FIVE UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD WITH FIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THE NEED FOR UNKNOWNWORD POWER UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL DO ONE BETTER . I WILL IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD A LAW THAT BEGINS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT ALL UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD - A MEASURE THAT WILL SAVE AMERICAN CONSUMERS UNKNOWNWORD BILLION A YEAR ON THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS . NOW , NONE OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THEY WILL TAKE TIME , THEY WILL TAKE SACRIFICE , AND THEY WILL TAKE A UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LEAD THIS COMMITMENT . I WILL NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD THESE GOALS IN MY STATE OF THE UNION AND THEN WALK AWAY WHEN THEY BECOME TOO DIFFICULT . I WILL REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERY YEAR ON THE STATE OF OUR ENERGY FUTURE , AND LET YOU KNOW THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TOWARD AN 80 % EMISSIONS UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD , TOWARD UNKNOWNWORD OVER A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR OIL CONSUMPTION BY UNKNOWNWORD , AND TOWARD IMPROVING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY 50 % BY UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ALSO MAKE AMERICA'S ENERGY SECURITY A FUNDAMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY BY UNKNOWNWORD OUR MILITARY TO DEAL WITH THREATS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE . AND THERE IS ONE UNKNOWNWORD I WILL TAKE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . FROM THE MOMENT I TAKE OFFICE , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE WORLD BACK TO WASHINGTON AND LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS READY TO LEAD AGAIN . THAT WE ARE READY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS IN TAKING ON THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGE OF THIS GENERATION . I WILL PERSONALLY REACH OUT TO THE LEADERS OF THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTING NATIONS IN BOTH THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING WORLD AND ASK THEM TO JOIN AMERICA IN UNKNOWNWORD A NEW GLOBAL ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLIMATE UNKNOWNWORD . IT WILL UNKNOWNWORD - AND ULTIMATELY UNKNOWNWORD WITH - THE MUCH LARGER UNKNOWNWORD PROCESS UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UN TO DEVELOP A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL BE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THESE LEADERS TO DEVELOP UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL OF US WILL MEET . WE WILL ALSO WORK TO BUILD AN ALLIANCE OF UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS AND WORK TOGETHER TO REDUCE OUR DEMAND , JUST LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS UNKNOWNWORD ON SUPPLY . AND AS WE DEVELOP NEW UNKNOWNWORD OF CLEAN ENERGY HERE AT HOME , WE WILL SHARE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND OUR INNOVATIONS WITH ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD . IF WE CAN BUILD A CLEAN COAL PLANT IN AMERICA , CHINA SHOULD BE ABLE TO AS WELL . IF WE FIND A WAY TO HARNESS THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUELS , INDIA WILL KNOW HOW TO DO IT TOO . AND AS WE TACKLE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS , WE WILL USE WHAT WE KNOW TO HELP THEM REDUCE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BUILD A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD THAT HELPS PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES IN CHINA SAID THAT THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD QUESTION HE GETS FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT EVERY POLICY UNKNOWNWORD HE UNKNOWNWORD IS , UNKNOWNWORD IT IS SO GOOD , WHY AREN'T YOU DOING IT ?" AND IT'S THE HARDEST QUESTION TO ANSWER . HE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD CAN POINT TO GOOD UNKNOWNWORD THAT SOME AMERICAN STATES , OR UNKNOWNWORD , OR COMPANIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD WE CAN'T POINT TO AMERICA ." I BELIEVE IT'S TIME THE WORLD COULD POINT TO AMERICA AGAIN . I WANT THE UNKNOWNWORD IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT TO OUR GREEN UNKNOWNWORD AS THE KIND UNKNOWNWORD LIKE TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS COUNTRY . I WANT THE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT TO OUR CARS AS THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR ALL THE WORLD . I WANT THE LEADERS OF EUROPE AND ASIA ; OF AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA TO POINT TO OUR DIPLOMACY AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND OUR INGENUITY AS THE LIGHT THAT LED US TOWARD A NEW ENERGY FUTURE IN OUR TIME . AND MOST OF ALL , I WANT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO POINT TO THIS GENERATION AND THIS MOMENT AS THE TIME WHEN AMERICA FOUND ITS WAY AGAIN . AS THE TIME WHEN AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE POLITICS AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN UNKNOWNWORD ERA SO THAT A NEW GENERATION COULD COME TOGETHER AND TAKE ON THE MOST URGENT CHALLENGE OF THIS ERA . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO LEAD US TOWARD THIS NEW ERA , AND I ASK ALL OF YOU TO JOIN ME IN TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE THAT UNKNOWNWORD AHEAD . THANK YOU . 
BLUE	THANK YOU , UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD TO A PRESIDENT IN SOME OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND HE HAS HELPED UNKNOWNWORD OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE AT UNKNOWNWORD TURNING POINTS . LET ME ALSO WELCOME ALL OF THE ELECTED UNKNOWNWORD FROM ILLINOIS WHO ARE WITH US . LET ME GIVE A UNKNOWNWORD WELCOME TO ALL OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD ME TO UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ FIVE YEARS AGO . AND I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSITY AND UNKNOWNWORD STUDENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD THIS EVENT . WE COME TOGETHER AT A TIME OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . A NEW UNKNOWNWORD YEAR HAS UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD ARE LEARNING THE NAMES OF NEW STUDENTS , AND STUDENTS ARE UNKNOWNWORD THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD CLASS . THAT COLD IS BEGINNING TO UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE CHICAGO UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD IS CHANGING . UNKNOWNWORD IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD WITH STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT SPENT A SINGLE DAY ON CAMPUS WITHOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A WAR IN IRAQ . FOUR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD AND FOUR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN . AND WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD THAT AMERICA'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS IN UNKNOWNWORD , AND THEIR FAMILIES , UNKNOWNWORD THE HEAVY UNKNOWNWORD . THE WIFE OF ONE SOLDIER FROM ILLINOIS WROTE TO ME AND SAID THAT HER HUSBAND UNKNOWNWORD LIKE HE'S UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ AND UNKNOWNWORD HOME ." THAT'S A TRAGIC UNKNOWNWORD . AND IT COULD BE UNKNOWNWORD BY FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE SEEN LOVED ONES UNKNOWNWORD TO TOUR AFTER TOUR OF DUTY . YOU ARE STUDENTS . AND THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENTS IS TO QUESTION THE WORLD AROUND YOU , TO QUESTION THINGS THAT DON'T ADD UP . WITH IRAQ , WE MUST ASK THE QUESTION : HOW DID WE GO SO UNKNOWNWORD ? THERE ARE THOSE WHO OFFER UP EASY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY WILL UNKNOWNWORD THAT IRAQ IS GEORGE UNKNOWNWORD WAR , IT'S ALL HIS FAULT . OR THAT IRAQ WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD AND INCOMPETENCE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD CHENEY . OR THAT WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IRAQ RIGHT IF WE WENT IN WITH MORE TROOPS , OR IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD INSTEAD OF PAUL UNKNOWNWORD , OR IF ONLY THERE WERE A STRONGER IRAQI PRIME MINISTER . THESE ARE THE EASY UNKNOWNWORD . AND LIKE MOST EASY UNKNOWNWORD , THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD TRUE . BUT THEY DON'T TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH , BECAUSE THEY UNKNOWNWORD A HARDER AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH . THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ IS NOT ABOUT A UNKNOWNWORD OF MANY UNKNOWNWORD - IT IS ABOUT ONE BIG MISTAKE . THE WAR IN IRAQ SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FOUGHT . FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY , I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK AT A UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ . THE VOTE TO UNKNOWNWORD THE WAR IN CONGRESS WAS LESS THAN TEN DAYS AWAY AND I WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE . SOME FRIENDS OF MINE UNKNOWNWORD ME TO KEEP UNKNOWNWORD . GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ , THEY UNKNOWNWORD OUT , WAS POPULAR . ALL THE OTHER MAJOR CANDIDATES WERE SUPPORTING THE WAR AT THE TIME . IF THE WAR GOES WELL , THEY SAID , YOU'LL HAVE UNKNOWNWORD YOUR POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD AWAY . BUT I DIDN'T SEE HOW SADDAM HUSSEIN POSED AN IMMINENT THREAT . I WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT A WAR WOULD DISTRACT US FROM AFGHANISTAN AND THE REAL THREAT FROM AL QAEDA . I WORRIED THAT UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD COULD LEAVE US UNKNOWNWORD DOWN IN A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND I BELIEVED THE WAR WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THE FLAMES OF EXTREMISM AND LEAD TO NEW TERRORISM . SO I WENT TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND I ARGUED AGAINST A UNKNOWNWORD WAR " - A UNKNOWNWORD BASED NOT ON REASON , BUT ON POLITICS " - UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNDETERMINED LENGTH , WITH UNDETERMINED COSTS , AND UNDETERMINED CONSEQUENCES ." I WAS NOT ALONE . THOUGH NOT A MAJORITY , MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OPPOSED GIVING THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR IN IRAQ . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , INCLUDING THE LEADER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE UNKNOWNWORD , SHARED MY CONCERNS AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD TO WAR . FOR US , THE WAR DEFIED COMMON SENSE . AFTER ALL , THE PEOPLE WHO HIT US ON 9/11 WERE IN AFGHANISTAN , NOT IRAQ . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING IN WASHINGTON HAS A WAY OF BUYING INTO STORIES THAT MAKE POLITICAL SENSE EVEN IF THEY DON'T MAKE UNKNOWNWORD SENSE . WE WERE TOLD THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT IRAQ FROM GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS WITH MILITARY FORCE . SOME LEADING DEMOCRATS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LINE THAT THERE WAS A UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA . WE WERE UNKNOWNWORD BY SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED VOICES IN WASHINGTON THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO LOOK TOUGH WAS TO TALK , ACT AND VOTE LIKE A REPUBLICAN . AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OLD UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT KENNEDY ONCE SAID - "THE UNKNOWNWORD OF PEACE IS NOT AS UNKNOWNWORD AS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR - AND UNKNOWNWORD THE WORDS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FALL ON DEAF EARS ." IN THE FALL OF UNKNOWNWORD , THOSE DEAF EARS WERE IN WASHINGTON . THEY UNKNOWNWORD TO A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ; WHO UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY AND UNKNOWNWORD ALLIES ; AND WHO SQUANDERED OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND THE SUPPORT OF THE WORLD AFTER 9/11 . BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE . BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST FAILED BY A PRESIDENT - THEY WERE FAILED BY MUCH OF WASHINGTON . BY A UNKNOWNWORD THAT TOO OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD SPIN INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BY A FOREIGN POLICY UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR WAR . AND MOST OF ALL BY THE MAJORITY OF A CONGRESS - A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF GOVERNMENT - THAT VOTED TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE UNKNOWNWORD AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR THAT HE USES TO THIS DAY . LET'S BE CLEAR : WITHOUT THAT VOTE , THERE WOULD BE NO WAR . SOME SEEK TO UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY . THEY ARGUE THAT THEY WEREN'T REALLY VOTING FOR WAR , THEY WERE VOTING FOR INSPECTORS , OR FOR DIPLOMACY . BUT THE CONGRESS , THE ADMINISTRATION , THE UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FALL OF UNKNOWNWORD . THIS WAS A VOTE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO WAR . THAT'S THE TRUTH AS WE ALL UNDERSTOOD IT THEN , AND AS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT NOW . AND WE NEED TO ASK THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE WAR : HOW CAN YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THEN ACT UNKNOWNWORD WHEN HE UNKNOWNWORD IT ? WITH ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GONE UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ , EVEN TODAY'S UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD . WE'VE GOT A UNKNOWNWORD THAT IS SOMEHOW UNKNOWNWORD A SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH IT HAS FAILED TO ENABLE THE POLITICAL RECONCILIATION THAT WAS ITS UNKNOWNWORD PURPOSE . THE FACT THAT VIOLENCE TODAY IS ONLY AS UNKNOWNWORD AS IN 2006 IS HELD UP AS PROGRESS . WASHINGTON POLITICIANS AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OVER EACH OTHER TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHILE OUR TROOPS FIGHT AND UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING TODAY IS JUST AS UNKNOWNWORD AS IT WAS IN UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT UNKNOWNWORD EXPERIENCE ONLY BY THE YEARS UNKNOWNWORD BEEN IN WASHINGTON , NOT BY YOUR TIME SPENT SERVING IN THE UNKNOWNWORD WORLD . THIS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST THE WAR , BUT NOT AGAINST THE HABITS THAT GOT US INTO THE WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE - THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD TO TALK UNKNOWNWORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WELL I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THINKING - I'M RUNNING TO CHALLENGE IT . I'M NOT RUNNING TO JOIN THE KIND OF WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD THAT LED US TO WAR IN IRAQ - I'M RUNNING TO CHANGE OUR POLITICS AND OUR POLICY SO WE CAN LEAVE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE THAN OUR GENERATION HAS FOUND IT . SO THERE IS A CHOICE THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS CAMPAIGN , ONE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND . THEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES : WHO GOT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY DECISION SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR RIGHT , AND WHO GOT IT UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF UNKNOWNWORD THE PAST . IT'S ABOUT WHO HAS THE BEST JUDGMENT TO MAKE THE CRITICAL DECISIONS OF THE FUTURE . BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT WASHINGTON WOULD LEARN FROM IRAQ . BUT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN JUST HOW UNKNOWNWORD OUT OF UNKNOWNWORD WASHINGTON GETS WHEN YOU CHALLENGE ITS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I SAID THAT AS PRESIDENT I WOULD LEAD DIRECT DIPLOMACY WITH OUR ADVERSARIES , I WAS CALLED UNKNOWNWORD AND IRRESPONSIBLE . BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE FAILED UNKNOWNWORD POLICY OF NOT TALKING TO OUR ADVERSARIES IF WE DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD THAT DIPLOMACY ? WHEN I SAID THAT WE SHOULD TAKE OUT UNKNOWNWORD TERRORISTS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD BIN LADEN IF WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , I WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD OF IRAQ WAR SUPPORTERS . THEY SAID WE CAN'T TAKE OUT BIN LADEN IF THE COUNTRY HE'S UNKNOWNWORD IN WON'T . A FEW WEEKS LATER , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE 9/11 UNKNOWNWORD - UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - UNKNOWNWORD WITH MY POSITION . BUT FEW IN WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD TO NOTICE . SOME PEOPLE MADE A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD ON THIS ISSUE . THEY SAID WE CAN TAKE OUT BIN LADEN , WE JUST CAN'T SAY THAT WE WILL . I REJECT THIS . I AM A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , AND I BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE I STAND . AND WHEN I SAID THAT WE CAN RULE OUT THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO TAKE OUT A TERRORIST TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD , IT WAS IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD " BECAUSE I DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IS THERE ANY MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WORLD WHO BELIEVES THAT WE NEED TO DROP A NUCLEAR BOMB ON A TERRORIST TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD ? WE NEED TO QUESTION THE WORLD AROUND US . WHEN WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT EXPERIENCE , WE CAN'T JUST UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE UNKNOWNWORD POLITICAL POINTS . WHEN WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT EXPERIENCE , WE CAN'T JUST TALK ABOUT WHO FOUGHT UNKNOWNWORD BATTLES - WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHO CAN FACE THE CHALLENGES AND SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF TOMORROW . BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT WE THINK ABOUT GEORGE BUSH , HE'S GOING TO BE GONE IN JANUARY UNKNOWNWORD . HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ENDING THE IRAQ WAR , BUT EVEN MORE IT'S ABOUT MOVING BEYOND IT . AND WE'RE NOT GOING BE SAFE IN A WORLD OF UNKNOWNWORD THREATS WITH THE SAME OLD UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT GOT US INTO IRAQ . WE'RE NOT GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD A DIVIDED AMERICA TO CONFRONT THESE THREATS WITH THE SAME OLD UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS OF JUST TRYING TO UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER SIDE . IN UNKNOWNWORD , WE WILL HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD OF OPPORTUNITY TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AND BRING OUR NATION TOGETHER . IF WE DON'T SEIZE THAT MOMENT , WE MAY NOT GET ANOTHER . THIS ELECTION IS A TURNING POINT . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET TO DECIDE : ARE WE GOING TO TURN BACK THE UNKNOWNWORD , OR TURN THE PAGE ? I WANT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU . IF YOU WANT UNKNOWNWORD WASHINGTON THINKING , I'M NOT YOUR MAN . IF YOU WANT RIGID IDEOLOGY , I'M NOT YOUR MAN . IF YOU THINK THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE CAN UNKNOWNWORD , I'M UNKNOWNWORD NOT YOUR MAN . BUT IF YOU WANT TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER , IF YOU WANT EXPERIENCE THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD THAN JUST LEARNING THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON , IF YOU THINK THAT THE GLOBAL CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE TOO URGENT TO UNKNOWNWORD , AND IF YOU THINK THAT AMERICA MUST OFFER THE WORLD A NEW AND HOPEFUL FACE , THEN I OFFER A DIFFERENT CHOICE IN THIS RACE AND A DIFFERENT VISION FOR OUR FUTURE . THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS END THIS WAR . AND THE RIGHT PERSON TO END IT IS SOMEONE WHO HAD THE JUDGMENT TO OPPOSE IT FROM THE BEGINNING . THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION IN IRAQ , AND THERE NEVER WAS . I WILL BEGIN TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ IMMEDIATELY . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD ONE OR TWO UNKNOWNWORD A MONTH , AND GET ALL OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ WITHIN UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS . THE ONLY TROOPS I WILL KEEP IN IRAQ WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PROTECTING OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON AL QAEDA . AND I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD NEEDED . LET THERE BE NO DOUBT : I WILL END THIS WAR . BUT IT'S ALSO TIME TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF IRAQ . WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFEAT THE THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY ON A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE CANNOT WIN A FIGHT FOR HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN WE OUTSOURCE CRITICAL UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN A BATTLE OF IDEAS WITH UNKNOWNWORD ALONE . MAKE NO MISTAKE : WE MUST ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO USE FORCE TO PROTECT AMERICA . BUT THE BEST WAY TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE IS NOT TO THREATEN TERRORISTS WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS - IT'S TO KEEP NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR MATERIALS AWAY FROM TERRORISTS . THAT'S WHY I'VE WORKED WITH REPUBLICAN SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO PASS A LAW UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR MATERIALS . AND THAT'S WHY I'LL LEAD A GLOBAL EFFORT TO SECURE ALL UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR MATERIALS DURING MY FIRST TERM IN OFFICE . BUT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE . WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR NUCLEAR POLICY AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS STILL FOCUSED ON UNKNOWNWORD THE SOVIET UNION - A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , INDIA AND UNKNOWNWORD AND NORTH UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS , AND IRAN IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR . MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS MEAN MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO US ALL . HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY AS PRESIDENT : AMERICA SEEKS A WORLD IN WHICH THERE ARE NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS . WE WILL NOT PURSUE UNKNOWNWORD DISARMAMENT . AS LONG AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD , WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD A STRONG NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE'LL KEEP OUR COMMITMENT UNDER THE NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TREATY ON THE LONG ROAD UNKNOWNWORD ELIMINATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS . WE'LL WORK WITH RUSSIA TO TAKE U.S . AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OFF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND TO UNKNOWNWORD REDUCE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MATERIAL . WE'LL START BY UNKNOWNWORD A GLOBAL BAN ON THE PRODUCTION OF UNKNOWNWORD MATERIAL FOR WEAPONS . AND WE'LL SET A UNKNOWNWORD TO EXPAND THE UNKNOWNWORD BAN ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD IS GLOBAL . AS WE DO THIS , WE'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO LEAD THE WORLD IN UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE ROAD IF WE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY THOSE UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S TIME TO STOP GIVING COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN AND NORTH UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL STRENGTHEN THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY SO THAT NATIONS THAT DON'T UNKNOWNWORD WILL UNKNOWNWORD FACE STRONG INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS . THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW ERA OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY . TO UNKNOWNWORD THE DAWN OF THAT ERA , WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO TALK TO ALL NATIONS , FRIEND AND UNKNOWNWORD . I'M NOT UNKNOWNWORD THAT AMERICA WILL LOSE A UNKNOWNWORD BATTLE WITH A PETTY UNKNOWNWORD - WE NEED TO GO BEFORE THE WORLD AND WIN THOSE BATTLES . IF WE TAKE THE ATTITUDE THAT THE PRESIDENT JUST UNKNOWNWORD IN FOR A UNKNOWNWORD AFTER AN UNKNOWNWORD HAS ALREADY BEEN REACHED , THEN WE'RE ONLY GOING TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH OUR FRIENDS . THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR INTERESTS . JUST LOOK AT OUR HISTORY . KENNEDY HAD A DIRECT LINE TO UNKNOWNWORD . NIXON MET WITH UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD DID THE HARD WORK OF UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . REAGAN WAS UNKNOWNWORD ARMS AGREEMENTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD EVEN AS HE CALLED ON HIM TO UNKNOWNWORD DOWN THIS WALL ." IT'S TIME TO MAKE DIPLOMACY A TOP PRIORITY . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO OPEN THEM IN THE TOUGH AND HOPELESS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WORLD . INSTEAD OF HAVING MORE AMERICANS SERVING IN MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO GROW OUR FOREIGN SERVICE . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE WORLD , I WILL PERSONALLY LEAD A NEW CHAPTER OF AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS TIME TO OFFER THE WORLD A MESSAGE OF HOPE TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HATE . MY EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT ME TO THE HOPELESS PLACES . AS A BOY , I LIVED IN UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT DREAM THE SAME DREAMS THAT I DID . AS AN ADULT , I'VE UNKNOWNWORD TO BE WITH MY FAMILY IN THEIR SMALL VILLAGE IN UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS STILL AN INSPIRATION . AS A COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD , I WORKED IN SOUTH SIDE UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY GLOBAL CHANGE . AS A SENATOR , I'VE BEEN TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD WHERE PROUD AND DIGNIFIED PEOPLE CAN'T HOPE FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE NEXT UNKNOWNWORD . IN THE 21ST CENTURY , PROGRESS MUST MEAN MORE THAN A VOTE AT THE BALLOT UNKNOWNWORD - IT MUST MEAN FREEDOM FROM FEAR AND FREEDOM FROM WANT . WE CANNOT STAND FOR THE FREEDOM OF UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD CAN WE SUPPORT THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE EMPTY UNKNOWNWORD . WE NEED NEW APPROACHES TO HELP PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES . THE UNITED NATIONS HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD DEVELOPMENT GOALS , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD TO CUT UNKNOWNWORD POVERTY IN HALF BY 2015 . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THEY WILL BE AMERICA'S GOALS . THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO KEEP THE UN FROM UNKNOWNWORD THESE GOALS ; THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL DOUBLE FOREIGN UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD BILLION TO LEAD THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE THEM . IN THE 21ST CENTURY , WE CANNOT STAND UP BEFORE THE WORLD AND SAY THAT THERE'S ONE SET OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICA AND ANOTHER FOR EVERYONE ELSE . TO LEAD THE WORLD , WE MUST LEAD BY EXAMPLE . WE MUST BE WILLING TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD , NOT JUST UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL REJECT TORTURE - WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD ; WE'LL CLOSE GUANTANAMO ; WE'LL BE THE COUNTRY THAT UNKNOWNWORD TELLS THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD THAT AMERICA IS YOUR UNKNOWNWORD , AMERICA IS YOUR DREAM , AMERICA IS YOUR LIGHT OF JUSTICE . WE CANNOT - WE MUST NOT - LET THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR VALUES BE A UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQ WAR . BUT WE CANNOT SECURE AMERICA AND SHOW OUR BEST FACE TO THE WORLD UNKNOWNWORD WE CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON . WE ALL KNOW WHAT IRAQ HAS COST US UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THESE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN AN UNKNOWNWORD ABUSE OF POWER AT HOME . WE FACE REAL THREATS . ANY PRESIDENT NEEDS THE UNKNOWNWORD TO CONFRONT THEM UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE'VE PAID A HEAVY UNKNOWNWORD FOR HAVING A PRESIDENT WHOSE PRIORITY IS EXPANDING HIS OWN POWER . THE UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR AND PEACE ARE USED AS POLITICAL TOOLS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER SIDE . WE GET UNKNOWNWORD TO ENDLESS SPIN TO KEEP OUR TROOPS AT WAR , BUT WE DON'T GET TO SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD COMING HOME . WE GET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FORCES , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES . ALL OF THIS HAS LEFT US WHERE WE ARE TODAY : MORE DIVIDED , MORE UNKNOWNWORD , MORE IN DEBT , AND MIRED IN AN ENDLESS WAR . A WAR TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD HAS BECOME AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY . THIS IS NOT AMERICA . THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE . IT'S TIME FOR US TO STAND UP AND TELL GEORGE BUSH THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOT BASED ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE PERSON , THE GOVERNMENT IS OF THE PEOPLE , BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE . WE THOUGHT WE LEARNED THIS LESSON . AFTER VIETNAM , CONGRESS UNKNOWNWORD IT WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE UNKNOWNWORD INTO WAR , AND EVEN WROTE A NEW LAW -- THE WAR POWERS ACT -- TO UNKNOWNWORD IT WOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD . BUT NO LAW CAN FORCE A CONGRESS TO STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT . NO LAW CAN MAKE UNKNOWNWORD READ THE INTELLIGENCE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THE CASE FOR WAR . NO LAW CAN GIVE CONGRESS A UNKNOWNWORD IF IT UNKNOWNWORD TO STAND UP AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD MADE IT . THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO CHANGE UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS TIME TO CHANGE OUR POLITICS . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO PUTS POLITICS AND UNKNOWNWORD OVER UNKNOWNWORD . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD BIG BUT DOESN'T FEEL THE NEED TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE DOOR ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE POLICY . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY - THEY ARE THE ANSWER . AND IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD LIKE THAT . I WILL ALWAYS TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH . I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU WHERE I STAND . IT'S WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS CAMPAIGN . IT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . I'LL LEAD A NEW ERA OF UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL GIVE AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WORLD " ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN WHICH I UNKNOWNWORD OUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY . I'LL DRAW ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT - AND GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ," AND I'LL HAVE MEMBERS OF MY NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM DO THE SAME . I'LL TURN THE PAGE ON A GROWING EMPIRE OF UNKNOWNWORD INFORMATION , AND RESTORE THE BALANCE WE'VE LOST BETWEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD IN A DEMOCRATIC UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD A NEW NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD CENTER . WE'LL PROTECT SOURCES AND UNKNOWNWORD , BUT WE WON'T USE SOURCES AND UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD TO HIDE THE TRUTH . OUR HISTORY DOESN'T UNKNOWNWORD TO WASHINGTON , IT BELONGS TO AMERICA . I'LL USE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT I DO RECEIVE TO MAKE GOOD POLICY - I WON'T UNKNOWNWORD IT TO SELL A BAD POLICY . WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE UNKNOWNWORD WHO TELL THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR . I WILL MAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AN UNKNOWNWORD WITH A UNKNOWNWORD TERM , LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE - NOT SOMEONE WHO CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD BY THE PRESIDENT . WE NEED UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AT THE TOP OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES . WE DON'T NEED POLITICS . MY TEST WON'T BE UNKNOWNWORD - IT WILL BE THE TRUTH . AND I'LL TURN THE PAGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENCY THAT UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL SECURITY AS A UNKNOWNWORD ISSUE - NOT AN AMERICAN ISSUE . I WILL CALL FOR A STANDING , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GROUP OF CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ON NATIONAL SECURITY . I WILL MEET WITH THIS UNKNOWNWORD GROUP EVERY MONTH , AND UNKNOWNWORD WITH THEM BEFORE TAKING MAJOR MILITARY ACTION . THE UNKNOWNWORD WILL STOP WITH ME . BUT THESE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE TO TAKE PLACE ON A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND SUPPORT FOR THESE DECISIONS WILL BE STRONGER IF THEY DRAW ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE NOT GOING TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD WE TURN THE PAGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT SAYS POLITICS IS JUST ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER SIDE . IT'S TIME TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA , BECAUSE WE ARE AT AN URGENT AND UNKNOWNWORD MOMENT . THERE ARE THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THERE ARE EASY UNKNOWNWORD TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE . WE CAN LOOK , THEY SAY , TO WASHINGTON EXPERIENCE - THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT GOT US INTO THIS WAR . OR WE CAN TURN THE PAGE TO SOMETHING NEW , TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS COUNTRY AND TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT . I AM NOT A UNKNOWNWORD MAN AND I WON'T BE A UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT . BUT MY OWN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD TELLS ME THAT THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD FORWARD WHEN WE UNKNOWNWORD OFF OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND SEEK NEW UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S WHAT BROUGHT MY FATHER ACROSS AN OCEAN IN UNKNOWNWORD OF A DREAM . IT'S WHAT I SAW IN THE EYES OF MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN UNKNOWNWORD WHO HEARD THE UNKNOWNWORD " AMERICA " AND THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND THE UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S WHAT I SAW IN THE STREETS OF THE SOUTH SIDE , WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAD EVERY REASON TO GIVE IN DECIDED TO UNKNOWNWORD THEMSELVES UP . IT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OF GOOD WILL DO COME TOGETHER TO TAKE ON TOUGH ISSUES . AND IT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN , WHEN OVER HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SEEK THE CHANGE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS . NOW I KNOW THAT SOME WILL UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S EASY TO BE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FOREIGN POLICY , YOU GET IT FROM ALL SIDES . SOME UNKNOWNWORD ON THE RIGHT WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ . SOME UNKNOWNWORD ON THE LEFT WILL TELL YOU THAT AMERICA CAN DO NO RIGHT IN THE WORLD . SOME UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE WASHINGTON SAYS , UNKNOWNWORD US , WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT ." AND WE KNOW HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THEY SAID THAT . YES , IT'S EASY TO BE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT RIGHT NOW , SOMEWHERE IN IRAQ , THERE'S SOMEONE ABOUT YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . HE'S MAYBE ON HIS SECOND OR UNKNOWNWORD TOUR . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD . HE WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME . BUT HE'S IN HIS UNKNOWNWORD , GOT HIS COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD ON . HE'S GETTING IN A UNKNOWNWORD . HE'S GOING OUT ON PATROL . HE'S LOST A UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS WAR , MAYBE MORE . HE UNKNOWNWORD HIS LIFE YESTERDAY , HE'S UNKNOWNWORD HIS LIFE TODAY , AND HE'S GOING TO RISK IT TOMORROW . SO WHY DO WE REJECT THE UNKNOWNWORD ? WE REJECT IT BECAUSE OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE HIM . WE REJECT IT BECAUSE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR SACRIFICE MUST BE A BETTER AMERICA . WE REJECT IT BECAUSE THEY UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT TO FREE THE UNKNOWNWORD AND FREE A UNKNOWNWORD FROM A UNKNOWNWORD ; WHO UNKNOWNWORD EUROPE AND SENT PEACE UNKNOWNWORD VOLUNTEERS AROUND THE GLOBE ; BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR A BETTER AMERICA AND A BETTER WORLD . AND I REJECT IT BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE ON THIS UNKNOWNWORD IF , THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY , AMERICA HAD NOT MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE OVER THE EASY CHOICE , THE AMBITIOUS CHOICE OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD CHOICE . I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE READY TO MOVE PAST THE FIGHTS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD . I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF , TIME AND AGAIN , THE UNKNOWNWORD HAD NOT BEEN PASSED TO A NEW GENERATION - TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS COUNTRY AT HOME , TO SHOW A NEW FACE OF THIS COUNTRY TO THE WORLD . I'M RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DO THE HARD WORK TO SEEK A NEW DAWN OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR OUR CHILDREN , AND FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD . 
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE A PART OF TODAY'S UNKNOWNWORD AND AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE FEW OTHER UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SO CENTRAL A ROLE IN BREAKING DOWN UNKNOWNWORD BARRIERS AND UNKNOWNWORD THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD TO THE IDEALS WE SEE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD THROUGHOUT THIS CITY . IT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT SENT THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE . IT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD TO BECOME UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FIRST TO BECOME UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CITY IN THE COUNTRY . IT WAS HERE , WITHIN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS CAMPUS , WHERE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD MINDS OF HIS DAY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD A MOVEMENT THAT CHANGED THE WORLD . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD THAT A BLACK MAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OBAMA CAN STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . BUT I AM NOT JUST RUNNING TO MAKE HISTORY . I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER , WE CAN CHANGE UNKNOWNWORD COURSE . IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO LOOK BACK IN UNKNOWNWORD OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME - I WANT US TO LOOK AHEAD WITH A FIERCE URGENCY AT HOW FAR WE HAVE LEFT TO GO . I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR THIS GENERATION TO MAKE ITS OWN UNKNOWNWORD - TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR OWN CHAPTER IN THE AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD . AFTER ALL , THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD ONLY SO THAT WE WOULD ALLOW UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR TIME . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DID NOT ARGUE UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT A COUNTRY WHERE TOO MANY UNKNOWNWORD MEN END UP IN UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD RATHER SPEND MORE TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD THAN TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD . DR . UNKNOWNWORD DID NOT TAKE US TO THE UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT WE WOULD ALLOW A TERRIBLE STORM TO UNKNOWNWORD THOSE WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD ; HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD TAKE A UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD ; THAT IT WOULD TAKE A HURRICANE TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD GOD UNKNOWNWORD US TO UNKNOWNWORD ; THE SICK HE UNKNOWNWORD US TO CARE FOR ; THE LEAST OF THESE HE UNKNOWNWORD US TO UNKNOWNWORD AS OUR OWN . THE UNKNOWNWORD AND COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO LEFT THEIR HOMES TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE STREETS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD INSTEAD OF TAKING THE UNKNOWNWORD AFTER A LONG DAY OF DOING SOMEBODY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SOMEBODY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - THEY DIDN'T BRAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WOULD STILL UNKNOWNWORD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY WHETHER THEIR VOTE WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD ; WHETHER THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT ; WHETHER JUSTICE WOULD BE EQUAL AND OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD . AND I AM CERTAIN THAT UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN DID NOT WALK THROUGH THE DOORS OF A SCHOOL IN LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT OUR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO SEE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT A SCHOOL IN UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO . IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD REMINDER THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THIS WEEK . BECAUSE WHEN THE DOORS TO THAT SCHOOL FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD , A NATION UNKNOWNWORD . THE PRESIDENT SENT THE UNITED STATES ARMY TO STAND ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE . THE CONGRESS PASSED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF UNKNOWNWORD . THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CREATED A CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD . AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TOOK TO THE STREETS IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS AND YEARS SO THAT MORE CHILDREN COULD WALK THROUGH MORE DOORS . THESE WERE NOT EASY CHOICES TO MAKE AT THE TIME . PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY SOME THAT SENDING THE ARMY DOWN TO LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE POLITICAL SUICIDE . THE RESISTANCE TO CIVIL RIGHTS REFORM WAS FIERCE . AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD FOR FREEDOM DID SO AT GREAT RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES . BUT THEY DID IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETIMES THERE ARE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN WHAT'S UNKNOWNWORD RISKY IS NOT TO ACT . WHAT'S UNKNOWNWORD RISKY IS TO LET THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD YEAR AFTER YEAR . WHAT'S UNKNOWNWORD RISKY IS TO WALK AWAY AND UNKNOWNWORD IT NEVER HAPPENED . WHAT'S UNKNOWNWORD RISKY IS TO ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE INSTEAD OF WORKING FOR WHAT COULD BE . IN A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S MORE UNKNOWNWORD WITH WHO'S UNKNOWNWORD WHO IN WASHINGTON AND HOW LONG UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IS GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD , THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE HARDER TO UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . BUT EVERY SO OFTEN , THEY DO UNKNOWNWORD . SOMETIMES IT TAKES A HURRICANE . AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES A UNKNOWNWORD OF JUSTICE LIKE THE ONE WE'VE SEEN IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL MAKE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE FIGHT ITSELF . AND IT'S TRUE THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE AS PARENTS TO UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR CHILDREN THAT VIOLENCE IS ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD WHEN IT UNKNOWNWORD ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO AND IT'S UNKNOWNWORD WHEN IT UNKNOWNWORD AT A UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER . UNKNOWNWORD WAS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TEACHING OUR CHILDREN THAT UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT TO UNKNOWNWORD UNDERSTAND UNKNOWNWORD , YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THAT FIGHT . YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A SCHOOL . YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE FULL MEASURE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD DONE BY THAT UNKNOWNWORD . YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW UNKNOWNWORD OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE FAILED THOSE SIX BOYS IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT FIGHT - THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ; THE UNKNOWNWORD AND EXCESSIVE UNKNOWNWORD ; THE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD WHO DID NOT CALL A SINGLE WITNESS . LIKE KATRINA DID WITH POVERTY , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WERE AROUND LONG BEFORE THAT UNKNOWNWORD FIGHT BROKE OUT . IT REMINDS US OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD AWAY TOO MANY YOUNG , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE BETTER PART OF THEIR LIVES - A DECISION THAT'S MADE NOT BY A UNKNOWNWORD IN A UNKNOWNWORD , BUT BY POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON . IT REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE BASED LESS ON THE KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD YOU UNKNOWNWORD THAN ON WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM . IT REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHOSE IDEA OF UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD IS TRYING TO ROLLBACK UNKNOWNWORD ACTION PROGRAMS AT OUR COLLEGE AND UNKNOWNWORD ; A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHOSE IDEA OF UNKNOWNWORD VOTING RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD IS TO LOOK FOR VOTING UNKNOWNWORD IN BLACK AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHERE IT DOESN'T UNKNOWNWORD . WE KNOW THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE THERE . WE KNOW THEY'RE UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET THEY GO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL PEOPLE FIND THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY THEY'RE UNKNOWNWORD . UNTIL SOMEONE FINALLY SAYS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT SCOOTER LIBBY GETS NO UNKNOWNWORD TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD OUR NATIONAL SECURITY , BUT A UNKNOWNWORD HONOR UNKNOWNWORD IS STILL UNKNOWNWORD IN A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN A UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD ." IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS . I UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF YOU HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OUT ON UNKNOWNWORD 6 OR TRAVELED TO THE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . I UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE UNKNOWNWORD OUT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CASE . I KNOW IT CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THIS KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD . I KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF UNKNOWNWORD IN IT . WHEN I WAS A STATE SENATOR IN ILLINOIS , WE HAD A DEATH UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM THAT HAD SENT UNKNOWNWORD INNOCENT PEOPLE TO DEATH UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD INNOCENT MEN - THAT WE KNOW OF . I WANTED TO REFORM THE SYSTEM . AND I WAS TOLD BY ALMOST EVERYONE THAT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE . THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD ; DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH POLITICAL RISK INVOLVED . BUT I BELIEVED THAT IT WAS TOO RISKY NOT TO ACT . AND AFTER UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CAME TOGETHER AND STARTED LISTENING . AND WE UNKNOWNWORD UP REFORMING THAT DEATH UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM . AND WE DID THE SAME THING WHEN I PASSED A LAW TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . SO DON'T EVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT CHANGE ISN'T POSSIBLE . DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUT AND STANDING UP AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD IS TOO RISKY . WHAT'S TOO RISKY IS KEEPING UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT'S TOO RISKY IS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY . I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING HERE AND TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD FOUR YEARS FROM NOW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT TODAY . I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT UNKNOWNWORD UP BEING UNKNOWNWORD ONCE THE CAMERAS ARE UNKNOWNWORD OFF AND THE UNKNOWNWORD DISAPPEAR . IT'S TIME TO SEEK A NEW DAWN OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA . FROM THE DAY I TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT , AMERICA WILL HAVE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD DEDICATED TO THE WORK IT BEGAN IN THE DAYS AFTER LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE DEPARTMENT OF UNKNOWNWORD AND POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD , AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS , THE CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD WILL ACTUALLY BE UNKNOWNWORD WITH CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS WHO UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND HATE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE'LL HAVE A VOTING RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD THAT ACTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD THE RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN TO VOTE WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD ARE PLACED IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD DAY , THAT WON'T ONLY BE AN UNKNOWNWORD , IT WILL BE A UNKNOWNWORD . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL ALSO WORK EVERY DAY TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS A UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN EVERY AMERICAN , UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , OR RACE , OR UNKNOWNWORD . THERE'S NO REASON THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE A QUALIFIED PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD TO DEFEND THEM . WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD MORE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD - AND I WILL ASK SOME OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MINDS HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OFFER . THERE'S ALSO NO REASON WE CAN'T PASS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LAW LIKE I DID IN ILLINOIS , OR ENCOURAGE STATE TO REFORM THE DEATH UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE DO NOT END UP ON DEATH UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING TOUGH ON UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD OF JUSTICE . DR . UNKNOWNWORD SAID IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD POLICY THAT'S BOTH TOUGH AND SMART . IF YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DRUGS , OF COURSE YOU SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT LET'S NOT MAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHEN THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE PEOPLE USING THEM . UNKNOWNWORD THINK THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD . REPUBLICANS THINK THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD . DEMOCRATS THINK THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD , AND YET IT'S BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN WILLING TO BRAVE THE POLITICS AND MAKE IT RIGHT . THAT WILL END WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I THINK IT'S TIME WE ALSO TOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE WISDOM OF UNKNOWNWORD UP SOME UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD DRUG UNKNOWNWORD FOR DECADES . SOMEONE ONCE SAID THAT UNKNOWNWORD MINIMUM UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SPACE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE FROM THEIR UNKNOWNWORD ." THAT SOMEONE WAS GEORGE W . BUSH - SIX YEARS AGO . I DON'T SAY THIS VERY OFTEN , BUT I AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT . THE DIFFERENCE IS , HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , I WILL . WE WILL UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD TO SEE WHERE WE CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD AND REDUCE THE BLIND AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE WILL GIVE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD DRUG UNKNOWNWORD A CHANCE TO SERVE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE UNKNOWNWORD , IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF DRUG UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PROVEN TO WORK BETTER THAN A UNKNOWNWORD TERM IN CHANGING BAD UNKNOWNWORD . SO LET'S REFORM THIS SYSTEM . LET'S DO WHAT'S SMART . LET'S DO WHAT'S JUST . NOW , THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT TAKING THESE UNKNOWNWORD WILL RESTORE A MEASURE OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY TO AMERICA . THEY WILL ALSO RESTORE A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN'T JUST WORK - IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE . BUT THERE IS A UNKNOWNWORD POINT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY . IF I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THIS NATION , I WILL ALWAYS BE A PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNDERSTANDS YOUR CONCERNS ; A PRESIDENT WHOSE UNKNOWNWORD IS LIKE SO MANY OF YOUR OWN - WHOSE LIFE'S WORK HAS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD WORK OF OUR LONG UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE . AND I WILL STAND UP FOR YOU , AND FIGHT FOR YOU , AND WAKE UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER . BUT THE TRUTH IS , ONE MAN CANNOT MAKE A MOVEMENT . NO SINGLE LAW CAN UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE HEART OF A CHILD WHO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD ON A UNKNOWNWORD ; OR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . NO ONE LEADER , NO MATTER HOW UNKNOWNWORD OR EXPERIENCED , CAN PREVENT UNKNOWNWORD FROM KILLING OTHER UNKNOWNWORD ON THE STREETS OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD ; OR FREE OUR UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HOPELESSNESS ; OR MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD . ONLY A COUNTRY CAN DO THESE THINGS . ONLY THIS COUNTRY CAN DO THESE THINGS . AND THAT IS WHY IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SERVE THIS NATION , THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT IS ASK YOU TO SERVE IT TOO . THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I'LL DO IS CALL ON YOU EVERY DAY TO TAKE A RISK AND DO YOUR PART TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS MOVEMENT FORWARD . AGAINST GREAT UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD DEEP UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL ASK YOU TO BELIEVE AGAIN THAT WE CAN RIGHT THE UNKNOWNWORD WE SEE IN AMERICA . I WOULD NOT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OUT TO CHICAGO AFTER COLLEGE TO ORGANIZE JOBLESS UNKNOWNWORD IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . I WOULDN'T HAVE ORGANIZED A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DRIVE , OR BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER , OR A UNKNOWNWORD LAW PROFESSOR , OR A STATE SENATOR , OR A U.S . SENATOR IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE TODAY IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . AND I KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TOO . ONE OF THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD THINGS ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD WAS THAT IT DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ANY ONE LEADER . THE CALL WENT OUT TO THOUSANDS ACROSS THE INTERNET AND BLACK UNKNOWNWORD AND ON COLLEGE UNKNOWNWORD LIKE THIS ONE . AND LIKE THE YOUNG AMERICANS OF ANOTHER ERA , YOU LEFT YOUR HOMES , AND GOT ON UNKNOWNWORD , AND TRAVELED SOUTH . IT'S WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS UNKNOWNWORD WHEN STUDENTS HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD AND AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO TRY AND UNKNOWNWORD A CITY THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S HOW REAL CHANGE AND TRUE JUSTICE HAVE ALWAYS COME ABOUT . IT TAKES A MOVEMENT TO LIFT A NATION . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO GO INTO OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND SAY THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST FIX OUR UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE SYSTEM ; WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS DON'T END UP THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE . WE NEED TO SET UP CHILD CARE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND JOB TRAINING AND DRUG UNKNOWNWORD TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A PLACE TO TURN TO . AND WE NEED PARENTS TO START ACTING LIKE PARENTS AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND READ TO THEM ONCE IN UNKNOWNWORD . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO FINISH WHAT BEGAN IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD , ARKANSAS . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT OF AMERICANS FROM EVERY CITY AND TOWN , OF EVERY RACE AND UNKNOWNWORD TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE OR WHERE YOU COME FROM , EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION THIS COUNTRY HAS TO OFFER . EVERY CHILD . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO DEMAND THAT WE REBUILD OUR UNKNOWNWORD SCHOOLS ; THAT WE UNKNOWNWORD IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ; THAT WE UNKNOWNWORD AN ARMY OF NEW TEACHERS , AND PAY THEM BETTER , AND SUPPORT THEM MORE . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON GETS THE CHANCE THAT UNKNOWNWORD GAVE ALL OF YOU ; TO SAY THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY , A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NO LONGER A UNKNOWNWORD FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT ; IT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVERY AMERICAN . SO WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR CLASSROOMS AND YOUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND YOU BEGIN ANOTHER YEAR AT UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSITY , I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER HOW FAR WE'VE COME , BUT I URGE YOU TO THINK HARD ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO GO . I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU WILL TAKE AND THE ROLE YOU WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN BUILDING THE MOVEMENT THAT WILL GET US THERE . AND I ASK YOU REMEMBER THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT UNKNOWNWORD WAS CALLED BY GOD TO LEAD HIS PEOPLE TO THE PROMISED LAND . AND IN THE FACE OF A UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS UNKNOWNWORD , ACROSS AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN ANGRY UNKNOWNWORD , HE SUCCEEDED IN LEADING HIS PEOPLE OUT OF UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . HE LED THEM THROUGH GREAT DANGERS , AND THEY GOT FAR ENOUGH SO THAT UNKNOWNWORD COULD POINT THE WAY UNKNOWNWORD FREEDOM ON THE FAR UNKNOWNWORD OF THE RIVER UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET , IT WAS NOT IN UNKNOWNWORD PLAN TO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD CROSS THE RIVER . INSTEAD HE WOULD CALL ON UNKNOWNWORD TO FINISH THE WORK THAT UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN . HE WOULD ASK UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE HIS PEOPLE THAT UNKNOWNWORD DISTANCE . EVERYONE IN THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF MANY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD MEN AND WOMEN WHO UNKNOWNWORD AND FOUGHT AND UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE RIGHTS AND UNKNOWNWORD WE ENJOY TODAY . THEY HAVE TAKEN US MANY MILES OVER AN IMPOSSIBLE JOURNEY . BUT YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION . AND IT IS NOW UP TO YOU TO FINISH THE WORK THAT THEY BEGAN . IT IS UP TO YOU TO CROSS THE RIVER . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD DISCOVERED THE CHALLENGE HE FACED , HE HAD HIS UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD TOLD UNKNOWNWORD NOT TO FEAR . HE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE , FOR I AM WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO ." THOSE ARE THE WORDS I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND HOPELESSNESS . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE , IN THE FACE OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND FEARS , IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD , IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD , IN THE FACE OF A UNKNOWNWORD RIVER . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE AND LET US CROSS OVER TO THAT PROMISED LAND TOGETHER . UNKNOWNWORD ON ANOTHER YEAR , AND THANK YOU SO MUCH . 
BLUE	YESTERDAY I UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AT THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND IN MANY WAYS , UNKNOWNWORD IS A UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NEW ECONOMY THAT'S TAKING HOLD - THE WEALTH CREATED ; THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S HELPING TO DRIVE GROWTH , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT NOW SPANS THE GLOBE . IT'S NO UNKNOWNWORD THAT A FUNDAMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY IS TAKING PLACE . IN UNKNOWNWORD AND ON BALANCE UNKNOWNWORD , AT POLICY UNKNOWNWORD AND AROUND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHERE THE SWIFT AND STRONG UNKNOWNWORD OF GLOBALIZATION ARE TAKING US . WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT AMERICANS ARE LIVING AND WORKING IN A UNKNOWNWORD CHANGING ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD . THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED . TIME AND AGAIN , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS UNKNOWNWORD UPHEAVAL - FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO FREE ; FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO INDUSTRY ; FROM PEACE TO UNKNOWNWORD , AND FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO PEACE . AND TIME AND AGAIN , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS UNKNOWNWORD STRONGER . THE ONE UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN THE ADVANCEMENT OF UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITY . THERE ARE FEW PRINCIPLES MORE BASIC TO OUR COUNTRY , AND THERE IS NONE MORE BASIC TO OUR ECONOMY . WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PLACE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD DREAM . AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE UNKNOWNWORD THAT DREAM OF OPPORTUNITY TO MORE AMERICANS , ALL OF US GAIN . AMERICANS ALSO KNOW THAT OPPORTUNITY DOESN'T COME EASY . YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT . HERE I THINK OF MY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HE RAISED HIS TWO CHILDREN WITH HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD CHICAGO . THEY FACED WHAT OTHER UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES FACED AT THE TIME - BOTH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR EFFORT TO GET AHEAD . AND THEY FACED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET , EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE , EVEN WHEN HE HAD TO LEAVE AN HOUR UNKNOWNWORD IN THE MORNING AND RELY ON A UNKNOWNWORD TO GET HIM THERE , HE WENT TO WORK AT THE UNKNOWNWORD WATER UNKNOWNWORD PLANT WHILE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HOME WITH THE CHILDREN . AND ON THAT SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS FAMILY , SENDING MY WIFE UNKNOWNWORD AND HER BROTHER UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS AN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUT IN MILLIONS OF FAMILIES EACH AND EVERY DAY . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD THAT IS SHARED BY THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO IS UP BEFORE DAWN AND THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO NEVER UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ; BY THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO WORKS LATE AND THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE NIGHT UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD THAT VALUES WORK , AND OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES . THIS UNKNOWNWORD COULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT A BASIC SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS COUNTRY . THAT UNKNOWNWORD SAYS THAT IF YOU WORK HARD , YOUR WORK WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD . THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A UNKNOWNWORD LIVING , TO RAISE A FAMILY , TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE BEST CHANCE AT SUCCESS , AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO A SECURE UNKNOWNWORD . THAT PEOPLE LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CAN GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE CHANCE TO DREAM UNKNOWNWORD , AND TO REACH NEW UNKNOWNWORD . THAT SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD IS STARTING TO UNKNOWNWORD . IN OUR NEW ECONOMY , THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW WEALTH . BUT UNKNOWNWORD ARE NOT KEEPING PACE . WORKERS ARE MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO JOB LOSS AND MORE WORRIED ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE AMERICANS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HEALTH CARE ARE PAYING MORE FOR IT - HEALTH CARE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD % IN THE LAST SIX YEARS . AMERICANS ARE FACING UNKNOWNWORD PERSONAL DEBT . FROM UNKNOWNWORD UP THE GAS TANK TO PAYING FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION , EVERYTHING SEEMS TO COST MORE . THIS IS NOT JUST HAPPENING BY CHANCE . IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN JUST UNKNOWNWORD UP TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S HAPPENING IN PART BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES WE'RE MAKING , AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE MAKING THOSE CHOICES . IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE'VE GONE TOO FAR FROM BEING A COUNTRY WHERE WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER , TO A COUNTRY WHERE UNKNOWNWORD ON THEIR OWN . TODAY , I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON ONE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICY WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES . BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD IS THIS UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR PRIORITIES MORE EVIDENT THAN IN OUR TAX POLICIES . INSTEAD OF WORKING TO FIND WAYS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE MIDDLE CLASS , WE'VE DEVELOPED UNKNOWNWORD WAYS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF HAVING ALL OF US PAY OUR FAIR SHARE , WE'VE GOT OVER UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CORPORATE TAX UNKNOWNWORD . THIS ISN'T THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET AT WORK . IT'S THE SUCCESSFUL WORK OF UNKNOWNWORD INTERESTS . FOR DECADES , WE'VE SEEN A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS COUNTRY TOWARD TAX CUTS THAT UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH , NOT WORK . AND FOR DECADES , WE'VE SEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD IN WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY GROW UNKNOWNWORD , WHILE THE COSTS TO WORKING PEOPLE ARE GREATER . WE'VE GOT A UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR TAX VALUES THAT UNKNOWNWORD BENEFITS THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS ; CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD THAT SERVE NO NATIONAL PURPOSE ; TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALLOW COMPANIES TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD OVERSEAS ; A GOVERNMENT THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD WHEN DEALING WITH UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES ; AN UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S TOO UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNDERSTAND , BUT JUST UNKNOWNWORD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK THE SYSTEM . WHEN BIG BUSINESS DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING IN THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD , THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD TO GET IT CHANGED , BUT MOST WORKING PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD - OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL - WE'VE HAD A SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON WHERE OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FEW . THE UNKNOWNWORD DON'T UNKNOWNWORD . AT A TIME WHEN UNKNOWNWORD INEQUALITY IS GROWING UNKNOWNWORD , THE BUSH TAX CUTS GAVE THE UNKNOWNWORD 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS A TAX CUT THAT WAS TWICE AS LARGE AS THE MIDDLE CLASS . AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER , WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM WORK AT NEARLY TWICE THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE'RE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . TALK ABOUT THIS IN UNKNOWNWORD COMPANY , AND SOONER OR LATER YOU'LL GET UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD CLASS UNKNOWNWORD . AS IF IT'S UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT OUT THAT SOME UNKNOWNWORD MAKE MORE IN TEN UNKNOWNWORD THAN A WORKER MAKES IN TEN MONTHS . OR , AS MY FRIEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PUT IT TO ME - UNKNOWNWORD THERE'S CLASS UNKNOWNWORD GOING ON IN AMERICA , THEN MY CLASS IS WINNING ." WHAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD KNOWS IS WHAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE TO REMEMBER - TO GET THROUGH THESE UNKNOWNWORD TIMES , WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN ONE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD OUT THERE ON UNKNOWNWORD STREET , THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR WALL STREET . WHEN THE CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY ARE LEAVING TOO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND , THE COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BEHIND . WHEN THAT DREAM OF OPPORTUNITY IS DENIED TO TOO MANY AMERICANS , THEN ULTIMATELY THAT UNKNOWNWORD HAS A WAY OF UNKNOWNWORD UP . WE WELCOME SUCCESS STORIES HERE IN AMERICA . WE UNKNOWNWORD THOSE WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE TOP OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . WE JUST NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD DOESN'T GET TAKEN AWAY FROM THE REST OF US . WE WANT A SYSTEM BASED ON UNKNOWNWORD - NOT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . TO UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE THROUGH THE CHANGE THAT'S TAKING HOLD , WE HAVE TO HOLD UNKNOWNWORD TO THAT UNKNOWNWORD PRINCIPLE : THAT OUR ECONOMY MUST UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS . MY OWN EXPERIENCE OVER TWO DECADES TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE AT THAT OPPORTUNITY , THEY WILL TAKE IT . THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AS A COMMUNITY UNKNOWNWORD ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO , WHERE WE SET UP JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAMS TO BRING HOPE TO PLACES THAT HAD BEEN HURT BY CHANGE . THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AS A STATE SENATOR IN ILLINOIS WHEN WE CREATED THE STATE EARNED UNKNOWNWORD TAX CREDIT SO WE COULD PUT $100 MILLION OF TAX CUTS INTO THE POCKETS OF WORKING FAMILIES . THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR , AS I'VE WORKED TO EXPAND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN IN MINIMUM WAGE FAMILIES , AND TO CLOSE UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD ON TO WORKING PEOPLE . AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ECONOMY , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM - THEY ARE THE ANSWER . I'LL RESTORE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS . IT'S TIME TO STAND UP TO UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL END THE UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENT THAT'S BUILT INTO OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD BY ELIMINATING CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD AND TAX UNKNOWNWORD . WE UNKNOWNWORD BE UNKNOWNWORD OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO BENEFIT A FEW POWERFUL INTERESTS - WE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD THAT EVERYONE UNKNOWNWORD THEIR FAIR SHARE , AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THEY WILL . AND IT'S TIME TO SHED SOME UNKNOWNWORD NOT ONLY ON COMPANIES THAT ABUSE THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD , BUT ALSO ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEM . WE'LL CREATE A LIST OF COUNTRIES WHERE TAX UNKNOWNWORD HIDE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AND COST AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR . WE'LL LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO NEW STANDARDS OF INFORMATION SHARING . AND WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THEIR TAX OBLIGATIONS . IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR A NEW CENTURY , WE NEED A TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S FAIR - A TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD WORK AND ADVANCES OPPORTUNITY . EVERY AMERICAN WHO IS READY TO WORK FOR THEIR AMERICAN DREAM SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THEY HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR THEM . I'LL KEEP THAT TRUST BY CUTTING TAXES FOR WORKING PEOPLE , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SENIORS , AND BY UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD FOR MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS . FIRST , I'LL GIVE A TAX CUT TO WORKING PEOPLE . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WORK LONGER AND HARDER THAN THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER WEALTHY NATION IN THE WORLD . BUT THEIR HOURS ARE GETTING LONGER AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AREN'T GETTING ANY HIGHER . THEIR COSTS ARE GOING UP , BUT THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY IS GOING DOWN . WHEN A SINGLE MOM GETS HER UNKNOWNWORD , THAT UNKNOWNWORD GETS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN SHE GOES TO BUY UNKNOWNWORD , THAT PURCHASE GETS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN SHE REACHES HER UNKNOWNWORD , HER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT GETS UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , HER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GET UNKNOWNWORD AT A LOWER RATE , AND THE CORPORATION SHE WORKS FOR HAS ALL KINDS OF UNKNOWNWORD BUILT INTO THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD UP FOR THEIR INTERESTS . IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO CHANGE . IT'S TIME FOR AMERICANS TO HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OFFICE WHO MAKES DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR INTEREST , NOT THE UNKNOWNWORD INTERESTS . LET'S NOT FORGET THAT EVEN IN THIS ERA OF ECONOMIC CHANGE , OUR WEALTH AS A NATION REMAINS FOUNDED ON WORK . I'D UNKNOWNWORD WORK BY UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUT OF UP TO UNKNOWNWORD PER PERSON - OR UNKNOWNWORD FOR EACH WORKING FAMILY - TO UNKNOWNWORD THE PAYROLL TAX THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING . AT A TIME WHEN CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS UNKNOWNWORD , THIS WILL GIVE MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS A BREAK , AND HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE RISING COSTS OF ENERGY , EDUCATION , AND UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . UNDER MY PLAN , UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS - AND THEIR FAMILIES - WILL GET A TAX CUT . AND BECAUSE THIS CREDIT WOULD BE GREATER THAN THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TAX BILL , MY PROPOSAL WOULD UNKNOWNWORD ALL UNKNOWNWORD TAXES FOR 10 MILLION WORKING AMERICANS . IN SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES , TWO PARENTS ARE WORKING FULL TIME , TRYING TO BRING UP THEIR CHILDREN , AND TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH SO MANY COSTS THAT KEEP GROWING WHILE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD DON'T . THIS TAX CREDIT WILL STRENGTHEN WORKING FAMILIES BY UNKNOWNWORD THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS , AND REDUCING THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD OVER SO MANY AMERICANS . AND THIS TAX CREDIT WILL BE A PARTICULAR UNKNOWNWORD TO SINGLE WORKING MOMS , WHO PUT IN THE HOURS TO PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES POSSIBLE FOR THEIR KIDS , BUT UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD THAT CAN'T COVER THEIR GROWING NEEDS . THE SECOND THING I'LL DO TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE MIDDLE CLASS IS PROVIDE A UNIVERSAL UNKNOWNWORD ' TAX CREDIT . IF WORK IS HOW MOST AMERICANS SEEK THEIR DREAM , A HOME IS HOW MANY FAMILIES UNKNOWNWORD IT . A HOME IS A SOURCE OF UNKNOWNWORD , A BUILDING UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE MOST VALUABLE THING THAT MOST MIDDLE CLASS UNKNOWNWORD WILL OWN . BUT - AS HAS BEEN MADE UNKNOWNWORD CLEAR THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS - THAT SOURCE OF UNKNOWNWORD CAN QUICKLY BECOME THE SOURCE OF ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD . TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE UNKNOWNWORD UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD NEED A BREAK . TODAY , WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IT ONLY GOES TO PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWNWORD ON THEIR TAXES . LIKE SO MUCH IN OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD , THIS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD THE UNKNOWNWORD . ONLY A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CREDIT . I'LL CREATE A UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST CREDIT SO THAT BOTH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD GET A BREAK . THIS WILL IMMEDIATELY BENEFIT 10 MILLION UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA . THE UNKNOWNWORD MAJORITY OF THESE ARE UNKNOWNWORD WHO MAKE UNDER UNKNOWNWORD PER YEAR , WHO WILL GET A BREAK OF 10 PERCENT OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST RATE . FOR MOST MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES , THIS WILL ADD UP TO ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD EACH YEAR . THIS CREDIT WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD A HAND TO MANY OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE STUCK IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS BY GIVING THEM SOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD OR SELL THEIR HOMES . THE UNKNOWNWORD THING I'LL DO IS PROVIDE A UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUT FOR AMERICA'S SENIORS . SINCE THE NEW DEAL , WE'VE HAD A BASIC UNDERSTANDING IN AMERICA . IF YOU WORK HARD AND PAY INTO THE SYSTEM , UNKNOWNWORD EARNED THE RIGHT TO A SECURE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE HELD UP THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN , MANY SENIORS ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO KEEP PACE WITH COSTS . AND AS SO MANY AMERICANS KNOW , THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AN ENTIRE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THIS UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN GREATER SINCE 1993 , WHEN TAXES ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WERE RAISED . MILLIONS OF SENIORS SAW THEIR UNKNOWNWORD BENEFITS GO DOWN . THEY ALSO HAD TO TAKE ON THE ADDED UNKNOWNWORD - AND SOMETIMES COST - OF UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD TAX RETURN . IT'S TIME TO GIVE AMERICA'S SENIORS A BREAK . SO I'LL GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE SAME KIND OF RELIEF I'LL OFFER TO WORKING PEOPLE . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL WORK TO SEE THAT NO UNKNOWNWORD MAKING LESS THAN UNKNOWNWORD EACH YEAR HAS TO PAY UNKNOWNWORD TAX . THIS WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TAXES FOR ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS , AT A SAVINGS RATE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD EACH YEAR . AND 22 MILLION SENIORS WON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD A RETURN AND UNKNOWNWORD AN EXPENSIVE TAX UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD PART OF MY PLAN WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD THE PROCESS OF UNKNOWNWORD A TAX RETURN FOR ALL AMERICANS . THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD HAS BECOME FAR TOO UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM , BUT UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO FIGURE THEM OUT WITHOUT GOING TO AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - YET ANOTHER COST AT TAX TIME . IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT TOOK 28 HOURS FOR AN UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD HER TAX UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , "THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM FACING TAXPAYERS TODAY IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ." THIS PAST YEAR , UNKNOWNWORD TODAY HAD FIVE DIFFERENT PROFESSIONALS ADD UP THE TAX BILL FOR ONE WORKING FAMILY - AND THEY ALL GOT DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S TIME TO CUT THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL PUT IN PLACE A SYSTEM WHERE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS WITH A JOB AND A UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT WHO TAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CAN DO THEIR TAXES IN LESS THAN FIVE UNKNOWNWORD . THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD WAGE AND UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT INFORMATION , SO THERE'S NO REASON THE UNKNOWNWORD CAN'T SEND AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS UNKNOWNWORD NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD . NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD TIME . NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR A TAX UNKNOWNWORD . MAKING THIS CHANGE WOULD SAVE AMERICANS MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN TAX UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD MILLION HOURS OF WORK , AND AN UNKNOWNWORD AMOUNT OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ABOUT MAKING AMERICA'S TAX UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND MAKING IT WORK BETTER FOR WORKING AMERICANS . AS WE UNKNOWNWORD THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT IT WORKS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS , WE'LL HAVE TO ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD COSTS . AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF AN ATTITUDE TOWARD UNKNOWNWORD AND SPENDING IN WASHINGTON THAT IS LEAVING A UNKNOWNWORD OF DEBT TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBLE , WE'LL GAIN UNKNOWNWORD BY SHUTTING DOWN CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD AND TAX UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL ALSO TURN THE PAGE ON AN UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUTS TO THE UNKNOWNWORD 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T NEED THEM AND DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM . WE'VE LOST THE BALANCE BETWEEN WORK AND WEALTH . I WILL CLOSE THE UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE TOP UNKNOWNWORD AND CAPITAL UNKNOWNWORD RATE TO SOMETHING UNKNOWNWORD TO - BUT NO GREATER THAN - THE RATES RONALD REAGAN SET IN UNKNOWNWORD . AS WE MAKE THESE CHANGES , WE'LL BE SURE TO ENCOURAGE GROWTH AND INNOVATION . SO WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES FROM CAPITAL UNKNOWNWORD TO GIVE THEM AN ADDED UNKNOWNWORD . BECAUSE WHEN MORE AMERICANS TAP THAT WELL OF OPPORTUNITY , ALL OF US ARE BETTER OFF . YOU KNOW , THE TRUTH IS , MOST AMERICANS AREN'T ASKING FOR A LOT . THEY DON'T NEED OVERSEAS TAX UNKNOWNWORD OR A LONG LIST OF UNKNOWNWORD . THEY JUST WANT A FAIR UNKNOWNWORD . AND THEY COULD STAND A BREAK . BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS HAVE SIMPLE DREAMS . A JOB . A PLACE TO RAISE THEIR FAMILY . A SECURE UNKNOWNWORD . A CHANCE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR KIDS THAT MIGHT UNKNOWNWORD A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THEIR OWN . AFTER ALL , THE WEALTH OF OUR NATION IS ROOTED IN THE WORK OF OUR PEOPLE . IN HIS FIRST STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE TO CONGRESS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OUT A UNKNOWNWORD PRINCIPLE : UNKNOWNWORD IS ONLY THE FRUIT OF LABOR , AND COULD NEVER HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IF LABOR HAD NOT FIRST UNKNOWNWORD . LABOR IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF CAPITAL , AND DESERVES MUCH THE HIGHER CONSIDERATION ." IT'S A SIMPLE PROPOSITION . THAT THE WEALTH WE EARN COMES FROM THE WORK THAT WE DO . IT'S A PROPOSITION THAT IS LIVED , DAY IN AND DAY OUT , IN THE HOMES OF MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF SIMPLE DREAMS . THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL OF THOSE DREAMS . NOW - AT A TIME OF RISING COSTS AND RISING UNCERTAINTY - IT'S TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD FROM WASHINGTON THAT PUT A LITTLE WIND AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION BEHIND A NEW UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY - ONE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A LIFT , SO THEY CAN LIFT UP THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD . 
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO THIS WEEK , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT TOOK HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT WAS A TIME WHEN FAITH IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WAS UNKNOWNWORD - A TIME WHEN TOO MANY OF OUR LEADERS UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING THAT SAID ALL WE COULD DO IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR PROBLEMS WOULD GO AWAY ON THEIR OWN . BUT UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE ROOSEVELT CALLED FOR A UNKNOWNWORD OF VALUES ." HE MADE CLEAR THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , OUR RIGHT TO LIVE MUST ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THE RIGHT TO LIVE UNKNOWNWORD ; THAT GOVERNMENT MUST UNKNOWNWORD NO SMALL GROUP AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL ITS CITIZENS ; AND THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO UNKNOWNWORD AS ONE NATION , UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBLE UNKNOWNWORD OF FINANCE AND INDUSTRY , INSTEAD OF ACTING EACH FOR UNKNOWNWORD , MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THE COMMON END ." THIS VISION OF AMERICA WOULD REQUIRE CHANGE THAT WENT BEYOND UNKNOWNWORD A FAILED PRESIDENT . IT WOULD REQUIRE A UNKNOWNWORD TRUST IN THE MARKET AND A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF OBLIGATION AND UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN BUSINESS AND WORKERS ; BETWEEN A PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENT . AS UNKNOWNWORD PUT IT , UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA , FAITH IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY , FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS , AND FAITH IN OURSELVES DEMANDS THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE NEW TERMS OF THE OLD SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD ." UNKNOWNWORD YEARS LATER , THIS FAITH IS CALLING US TO ACT ONCE MORE . WE CERTAINLY DO NOT FACE A TEST OF THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION DID . BUT WE ARE TESTED STILL . WE MEET AT A TIME WHEN MUCH OF WALL STREET IS UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HERE AT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA , THE UNKNOWNWORD ARE BEING WATCHED WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNCERTAINTY . THERE IS MUCH UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD MEETING OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , AND WITH EACH NEW DAY , THERE IS HOPE THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD WILL BRING BETTER NEWS THAN THE LAST . IT IS A HOPE SHARED BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS , MEN AND WOMEN , WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNCERTAINTY LONG BEFORE IT UNKNOWNWORD ON WALL STREET . THEY ARE THE FAMILIES I MEET EVERY DAY WHO ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR A UNKNOWNWORD THAT ISN'T GETTING ANY UNKNOWNWORD AND CAN'T SEEM TO COVER THE RISING COST OF HEALTH CARE AND UNKNOWNWORD AND TAXES . THEY ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS I'VE MET IN UNKNOWNWORD , ILLINOIS AND UNKNOWNWORD , IOWA - WORKERS WHO BELIEVED THEY WOULD UNKNOWNWORD AND NEVER HAVE TO WORK AGAIN ; WORKERS WHO NOW COMPETE WITH THEIR UNKNOWNWORD FOR MINIMUM WAGE JOBS AT UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD MOVED OVERSEAS . THESE AMERICANS AND MANY OTHERS WERE ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE THE PROBLEMS ON WALL STREET UNKNOWNWORD . NOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR HOMES AND UNKNOWNWORD IF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD SOURCE OF WEALTH WILL STILL HAVE THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD IN ANOTHER YEAR , OR EVEN ANOTHER MONTH . AND WE'RE ALL UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER THIS WILL UNKNOWNWORD OVER TO THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY . SO WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED RIGHT NOW TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR MARKETS . WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR MARKETS . BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS ANOTHER MOMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD , IN UNKNOWNWORD WORDS , A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR VALUES AS A NATION . I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA'S FREE MARKET HAS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICA'S GREAT PROGRESS . IT'S CREATED A PROSPERITY THAT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WORLD . IT'S LED TO A UNKNOWNWORD OF LIVING UNMATCHED IN HISTORY . AND IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD GREAT UNKNOWNWORD TO THE INNOVATORS AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAVE MADE AMERICA A UNKNOWNWORD FOR SCIENCE , AND TECHNOLOGY , AND UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAS ONLY WORKED BECAUSE WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD INVISIBLE HAND WITH A HIGHER PRINCIPLE . IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER . FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD , FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS , WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN EACH UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS BECAUSE THE MORE AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD , THE MORE AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD UNKNOWNWORD OF INDUSTRY WHO'VE MADE IT THEIR MISSION TO PAY WELL ENOUGH THAT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD COULD AFFORD THE PRODUCTS THEY MADE . THAT'S WHY UNKNOWNWORD AT COMPANIES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD DON'T MIND THE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD - BECAUSE THEY SHARE IN THAT SUCCESS JUST THE SAME . AND THAT'S WHY OUR ECONOMY HASN'T JUST BEEN THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD - IT'S BEEN THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD JOB UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN HISTORY . WE HAVE NOT COME THIS FAR BECAUSE WE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . AMERICA IS AMERICA BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD IN WHICH ALL CAN SUCCEED . OUR FREE MARKET WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A FREE UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE UNKNOWNWORD YOU CAN GET , UNKNOWNWORD YOU CAN GET IT . AND SO FROM TIME TO TIME , WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD OF THE ROAD TO MAKE COMPETITION FAIR , AND OPEN , AND HONEST . WE HAVE DONE THIS NOT TO UNKNOWNWORD PROSPERITY OR UNKNOWNWORD , BUT TO UNKNOWNWORD THOSE THINGS AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT THEY ARE SHARED AND SPREAD AS UNKNOWNWORD AS POSSIBLE . IN UNKNOWNWORD YEARS , WE HAVE SEEN A DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED OUR MARKET TO WORK AND OUR ECONOMY TO UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA OR WHAT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS , A UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD INTO CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD OF WASHINGTON AND THE BUSINESS WORLD THAT SAYS , "WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD ENOUGH ." IN OUR GOVERNMENT , WE SEE CAMPAIGN UNKNOWNWORD AND LOBBYISTS USED TO CUT UNKNOWNWORD AND WIN UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WHO UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD . MASSIVE TAX CUTS ARE UNKNOWNWORD OUTSIDE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE USED TO HIDE THE FULL COST OF THIS WAR . IN THE BUSINESS WORLD , IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD THAT SEES UNKNOWNWORD OF INTEREST AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFIT . THE UNKNOWNWORD KILL IS UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD TO LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE ECONOMY . AND WHILE THIS MAY BENEFIT THE FEW WHO PUSH THE UNKNOWNWORD AS FAR AS IT WILL GO , IT'S DOESN'T BENEFIT AMERICA AND IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE MARKET . JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES MONEY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS . IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS WHEN BOARDS ALLOW THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO SET THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR STOCK UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD GET RICH UNKNOWNWORD OF HOW THEY UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S BAD FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD LINE WHEN UNKNOWNWORD RECEIVE MASSIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AFTER UNKNOWNWORD DOWN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS AND UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD ; OR WHEN THEY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH COMPANY UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S BAD FOR COMPETITION WHEN YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S WILLING TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AFTER UNKNOWNWORD WITH BARELY ANY UNKNOWNWORD . SUCH AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD INNOVATION , IT UNKNOWNWORD CONSUMERS OF CHOICE , IT MEANS HIGHER UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST IT . AND IT'S BAD FOR THE MARKET WHEN THERE ARE OVER UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CORPORATE TAX UNKNOWNWORD , OR WHEN SOME COMPANIES GET TO SET UP A UNKNOWNWORD IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO AVOID PAYING ANY TAXES AT ALL . THIS MEANS A GREATER SHARE OF TAXES FOR AMERICANS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO COMPETE BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR WAY TO MORE UNKNOWNWORD . IT ALSO MEANS THAT INVESTMENT GOES TO THE COMPANIES THAT ARE BEST CONNECTED INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT ARE MOST PRODUCTIVE . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TELLS US UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST POLITICS UNKNOWNWORD THE FREE MARKET . AFTER ALL , WHY WOULD AN OIL COMPANY UNKNOWNWORD IN RESEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT COULD SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY CAN GET BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES TO KEEP UNKNOWNWORD FOR OIL AND GAS ? THESE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE WASTEFUL , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE VERY UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . THEY BENEFIT THE UNKNOWNWORD FEW AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD . IN FACT , THE UNKNOWNWORD WITH THIS UNKNOWNWORD ISN'T JUST THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD , IT'S THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD OUR MARKETS . MARKETS CAN'T UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT THE TRUST OF UNKNOWNWORD AND THE PUBLIC . AT A MOST BASIC UNKNOWNWORD , CAPITAL MARKETS WORK BY UNKNOWNWORD CAPITAL TO THE PLACE WHERE IT IS MOST PRODUCTIVE . WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD , THAT CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD . IF THE INFORMATION IS FLAWED , IF THERE IS UNKNOWNWORD , OR IF THE UNKNOWNWORD FACING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT FULLY UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE STOP INVESTING BECAUSE THEY FEAR THEY'RE BEING HAD . WHEN THE PUBLIC TRUST IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ENOUGH , IT CAN BRING FINANCIAL MARKETS TO THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . WE ALL SUFFER WHEN WE DO NOT UNKNOWNWORD THAT MARKETS ARE UNKNOWNWORD , OPEN AND HONEST . WE SAW THIS DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN UNKNOWNWORD OF INTEREST BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHOSE RESEARCH WAS SUPPOSED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY WORKED FOR LED UNKNOWNWORD TO DOUBT THE MARKETS IN UNKNOWNWORD . WE SAW IT DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SCANDALS WHEN MAJOR PUBLIC COMPANIES UNKNOWNWORD PUMPED UP THEIR EARNINGS , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD LOOK BETTER - A UNKNOWNWORD THAT ULTIMATELY LED UNKNOWNWORD TO QUESTION THE BALANCE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL COMPANIES . AND WE CANNOT HELP BUT SEE SOME UNKNOWNWORD OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD STARTED OFF AS A GOOD IDEA - HELPING AMERICANS BUY HOMES WHO COULDN'T UNKNOWNWORD AFFORD TO . FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CREATED NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD THEM INTO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD RISK UNKNOWNWORD AND SPREAD THEM OUT AMONG UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , THIS SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO BE LESS RISKY AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT AS CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE MADE , THEY BEGAN TO LOWER THEIR STANDARDS . SOME UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO GET THE UNKNOWNWORD DONE . SOME UNKNOWNWORD STARTED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THEY DIDN'T HAVE JUST TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD , AND SOME WERE ENGAGING IN IRRESPONSIBLE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT MANY UNKNOWNWORD WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE FINE UNKNOWNWORD . AND UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES BEGAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE VERY UNKNOWNWORD . MOST EVERYONE KNEW THAT SOME OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD WERE JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE , BUT ALL THAT MONEY UNKNOWNWORD IN MADE IT UNKNOWNWORD TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY AND IGNORE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF SOME BAD UNKNOWNWORD AND YET , TIME AND AGAIN WE WERE UNKNOWNWORD THIS COULD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE FORMER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD PASSED AWAY TWO WEEKS AGO , WROTE AN ENTIRE BOOK UNKNOWNWORD THIS VERY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD CALLS FOR BETTER UNKNOWNWORD AND STRONGER UNKNOWNWORD WERE MET WITH MILLIONS IN UNKNOWNWORD INDUSTRY UNKNOWNWORD . FAR TOO MANY CONTINUED TO PUT THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD GAIN AHEAD OF WHAT THEY KNEW THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE WHEN THOSE RATES UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOW CLEAR : NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES . MILLIONS MORE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COULD SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR OWN HOME UNKNOWNWORD - WITH SOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A COST OF NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD BILLION , UNKNOWNWORD IN LOST HOME UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD COST TO UNKNOWNWORD IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD BILLION UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE IMPACT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD MARKET AND UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY HAS BEEN SO GREAT THAT SOME UNKNOWNWORD ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD A POSSIBLE UNKNOWNWORD - A UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US HOPE DOES NOT COME TO PASS . THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LESSONS THAT WE MUST LEARN FROM THIS GOING FORWARD . WE KNOW THAT MUCH OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD IF THE MARKET UNKNOWNWORD WITH MORE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE ALSO KNOW WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER OFF IF THERE WERE GREATER UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE INFORMATION HAD BEEN UNKNOWNWORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO THAT UNKNOWNWORD , I BELIEVE THERE ARE A FEW UNKNOWNWORD WE SHOULD TAKE TO PREVENT FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS KIND AND RESTORE SOME MEASURE OF PUBLIC TRUST IN THE MARKET : FIRST , WE NEED MORE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD MARKET . TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT POTENTIAL UNKNOWNWORD AREN'T UNKNOWNWORD INTO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THEY CAN'T AFFORD , I'VE PROPOSED UNKNOWNWORD THE CURRENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO ESTABLISH A FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TOUGH UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD ACT IN BAD FAITH . I'VE ALSO PROPOSED A HOME UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM THAT WOULD CREATE A UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR HOME UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD OF LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD . THIS WOULD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS BY ALLOWING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO EASILY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PRODUCTS SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD THE MEANINGFUL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST FOR FAR TOO LONG . SECOND , I BELIEVE THAT IF WE HOPE TO RESTORE TRUST IN THE MARKETS , WE MUST BE ABLE TO TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF GOVERNMENT TO EXERCISE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES WILL COST UNKNOWNWORD AND PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS - UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY UNKNOWNWORD . WE CANNOT LET THE PUBLIC TRUST BE LOST BY A UNKNOWNWORD OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES AND THE PEOPLE THEY'RE UNKNOWNWORD . AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD US , THIS HAPPENED WHEN UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES CONTINUED TO GIVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD DESPITE ITS IMPENDING BANKRUPTCY . AND OF COURSE WE SAW IT THIS YEAR WHEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CONTINUED TO RECEIVE STRONG UNKNOWNWORD DESPITE UNKNOWNWORD WARNINGS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE IMPENDING UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MARKET . HERE'S THE REAL UNKNOWNWORD - IF THE PUBLIC COMES TO VIEW THIS LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , THE MARKETS WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD BY A CRISIS IN CONFIDENCE . WE MUST TAKE UNKNOWNWORD TO AVOID THAT AT ALL COSTS , AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND BUSINESS UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD THING WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT OTHER AREAS IN THE MARKET WHERE A LACK OF UNKNOWNWORD COULD LEAD TO UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS . MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD THESE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEBT TO CREDIT UNKNOWNWORD , AND IF THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY'RE TAKING ON , OR ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THIS COULD UNKNOWNWORD INTO A SECOND CRISIS DOWN THE ROAD . THAT'S WHY I'M UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD CREDIT CARD UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM TO UNKNOWNWORD CONSUMERS ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF RISK INVOLVED IN EVERY CREDIT CARD THEY UNKNOWNWORD UP FOR , INCLUDING HOW EASILY THE COMPANY CAN CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE . IF MORE AMERICANS WERE UNKNOWNWORD WITH THIS KIND OF INFORMATION BEFORE THEY UNKNOWNWORD RISKY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE CURRENT CRISIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED . NOW THAT SO MANY ARE IN DEBT , WE UNKNOWNWORD LET THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD STANDARDS CREATE ANOTHER . FINALLY , WHILE IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , I HAVE HEARD MANY OF YOU SAY THAT YOU HOPE FOR A UNKNOWNWORD RATE CUT TOMORROW TO UNKNOWNWORD THE MARKET UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS WHO MAY LOSE THEIR HOMES NO MATTER WHAT UNKNOWNWORD TOMORROW . AND SO FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD , I ASK THEM TO SHOW SOME UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD TRYING TO SELL OR UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE IN THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS COMPANIES ARE , BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES UNKNOWNWORD TO PROTECT THEMSELVES . NOW , IN ADDITION TO THESE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS A LARGER LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS . IN THIS MODERN , UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY , THERE IS NO UNKNOWNWORD LINE BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD STREET AND WALL STREET . THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MATTER AND HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY . AND WHETHER THOSE AMERICANS KEEP THEIR HOMES OR THEIR JOBS ; WHETHER THEY CAN SPEND WITH CONFIDENCE AND AVOID UNKNOWNWORD INTO DEBT - THAT UNKNOWNWORD AND HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENTIRE MARKET . WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN EACH UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS . WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ; THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD THOSE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESSFUL INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO ARE JUST SUCCESSFUL AT UNKNOWNWORD THE SYSTEM . BECAUSE IF THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE TAUGHT US ANYTHING , IT'S THAT WE CAN ALL SUFFER FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A FEW . TURNING A BLIND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE CRONYISM IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD CAN PUT US ALL IN UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . SO I PROMISE YOU THIS . I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN YOUR SUCCESS . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD YOUR UNKNOWNWORD TO THIS COUNTRY AND I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO ENCOURAGE IT , BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT HOW WELL YOU DO IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO HOW WELL AMERICA DOES . AND I WILL ALWAYS BE A STRONG UNKNOWNWORD FOR A MARKET THAT IS FREE AND OPEN . BUT TODAY I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN SAYING THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , WE WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD A MARKET THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD . WE WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD A MARKET THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD BY LOBBYISTS WHO DON'T UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERESTS OF REAL AMERICANS OR MOST BUSINESSES . AND WE WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD "WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD ENOUGH " ANY LONGER - BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH IS WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA . I AM ALSO ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN DOING SOMETHING ELSE TODAY . I AM ASKING YOU TO REMIND UNKNOWNWORD THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , WE RISE OR FALL AS ONE PEOPLE . AND I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN UNKNOWNWORD IN A NEW ERA OF UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA . RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD TO GET BY FOR QUITE SOME TIME . THEY HAVE WATCHED THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THEIR HEALTH COSTS RISE AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD DISAPPEAR . SOME HAVE SEEN JOBS UNKNOWNWORD OVERSEAS AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND NEW ONES THAT PAY MUCH LESS . SOME TELL THEIR CHILDREN THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE THIS YEAR , OTHERS SEND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO A SCHOOL THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THEM . I MEET THESE AMERICANS EVERY SINGLE DAY - PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD BY A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD CHANGED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . THEY UNDERSTAND THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN TECHNOLOGY AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD BORDERS AND UNKNOWNWORD UP NEW MARKETS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES . THEY KNOW WE CAN'T GO BACK TO YESTERDAY OR WALL OFF OUR ECONOMY FROM EVERYONE ELSE . THEIR PROBLEM IS NOT THAT OUR WORLD IS UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S THAT OUR UNKNOWNWORD FIELD ISN'T UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S THAT OPPORTUNITY IS NO LONGER EQUAL . AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CANNOT ACCEPT ANYMORE . FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO HAS UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT THERE IS NOTHING AMERICA CAN DO ABOUT THIS . HE HAS LOOKED AWAY FROM THESE CHALLENGES AND UNKNOWNWORD A PHILOSOPHY OF "WHAT'S BAD FOR YOU IS NOT MY PROBLEM ." AND IF WE ARE HONEST , I THINK WE MUST UNKNOWNWORD THAT THOSE WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE NEW GLOBAL MARKETPLACE - AND THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALMOST EVERYONE IN THIS UNKNOWNWORD - HAVE NOT ALWAYS CONCERNED THEMSELVES WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS NEW ECONOMY . THERE HAS BEEN A UNKNOWNWORD , DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD TIMES , TO UNKNOWNWORD THE CASUALTIES OF A CHANGING ECONOMY TO BE INEVITABLE , AND TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR LOWER TAX RATES ON WALL STREET EARNINGS AS PART OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS . INDEED , RATHER THAN UNKNOWNWORD THIS GROWING SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITY FOR MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS , THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH ITS TAX POLICIES AND SPENDING PRIORITIES - TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS GREATER UNKNOWNWORD INEQUALITY NOW THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT MAY BE TRUE , AS SOME HAVE ARGUED , THAT LARGER FORCES ARE AT WORK HERE - THAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNKNOWNWORD AND GLOBALIZATION HAVE UNKNOWNWORD A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY . IT IS TRUE AS WELL THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY LOOK UNKNOWNWORD FOR SOLUTIONS - TO TRY TO UNKNOWNWORD OFF THE WORLD BEYOND OUR BORDERS , OR TO HOPE THAT THE NEW DEAL PROGRAMS BORN OF A DIFFERENT ERA ARE , BY THEMSELVES , SOMEHOW UNKNOWNWORD TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE . NO , WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADAPT OUR INSTITUTIONS TO A NEW WORLD AS WE ALWAYS HAVE . AND IN DOING SO , WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE RISE AND FALL AS ONE NATION ; THAT A COUNTRY IN WHICH ONLY A FEW UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR IDEALS AND OUR DEMOCRACY ; THAT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE BLESSINGS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE A SOLEMN OBLIGATION TO OPEN THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY , NOT JUST FOR OUR CHILDREN , BUT TO ALL OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN ; AND THAT UNKNOWNWORD WE TAKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERESTS OF ALL AMERICANS IN GROWTH AND PROSPERITY , WE MAY GENERATE A POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO BOTH . AND SO , IN THE COMING WEEKS , I WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD OUT A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR AMERICA . IT'S AN AGENDA THAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FIELD FOR MORE AMERICANS TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT AMERICA CAN COMPETE AND UNKNOWNWORD IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY . IT WILL FOCUS ON THREE UNKNOWNWORD AREAS . TOMORROW , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE FIRST PART OF MY AGENDA - A PLAN TO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD GREATER OPPORTUNITY AND MORE RELIEF TO MORE AMERICANS . FOR FAR TOO LONG , OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN SO UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT'S UNKNOWNWORD THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS . AT A TIME WHEN MOST AMERICANS ARE FACING STAGNANT UNKNOWNWORD AND RISING COSTS , THAT'S NOT FAIR AND IT DOESN'T BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY . MY PLAN WILL GIVE A BREAK TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS , SENIORS , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD TODAY'S UNKNOWNWORD AND UNCERTAINTY , BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN UNKNOWNWORD THEIR CONFIDENCE AND INVESTING IN THEIR PROSPERITY . THE SECOND PART OF MY AGENDA WILL BE TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE IN THE 21ST CENTURY . THIS STARTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD EVERY AMERICAN WITH A UNKNOWNWORD EDUCATION FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . WE KNOW THAT IN THIS ECONOMY , COUNTRIES THAT UNKNOWNWORD US TODAY WILL UNKNOWNWORD US TOMORROW . AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT CHINA IS ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD FOUR TIMES AS MANY UNKNOWNWORD AS WE DO AND THAT OUR SHARE OF UNKNOWNWORD WITH COLLEGE UNKNOWNWORD NOW FALLS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN'T ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL BEHIND . THAT MEANS INVESTING IN EARLY CHILD EDUCATION . IT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD AN ARMY OF NEW , QUALIFIED TEACHERS WHO WE PAY MORE AND SUPPORT MORE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEIR JOB IS TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY . AND IT MEANS FINALLY MAKING A COLLEGE EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AND UNKNOWNWORD TO EVERY AMERICAN . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ONCE SAID THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS THE 21ST CENTURY WEALTH ," AND I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD IF WE HOPE TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS CENTURY . UNKNOWNWORD OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE ALSO MEANS INVESTING MORE IN THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD SO MUCH OF OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC GROWTH . AND ONE PLACE WHERE THAT INVESTMENT WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS IN A RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD ON FOREIGN OIL . WE KNOW THIS UNKNOWNWORD ISN'T UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR SECURITY . WE KNOW IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE PLANET . AND I'VE TALKED TO COUNTLESS UNKNOWNWORD AND BUSINESS LEADERS WHO KNOW IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR ECONOMY TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OIL MARKET . I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN A RENEWABLE FUTURE THAT WILL CREATE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS AND ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES THAT CAN FUEL OUR PROSPERITY WELL INTO THE NEXT CENTURY . FINALLY , THE UNKNOWNWORD PART OF MY AGENDA WILL BE TO UNKNOWNWORD AND STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR WORKING AMERICANS . LIKE ALL OF YOU , I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE . BUT WE HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS , ITS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ITS BENEFITS . AND SO IF WE WANT TO AVOID RISING UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS COUNTRY ; IF WE EXPECT WORKING AMERICANS TO ACCEPT AND EVEN UNKNOWNWORD FREE TRADE , THEN I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN UNKNOWNWORD POLICIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY . THAT MEANS HEALTH INSURANCE AND A UNKNOWNWORD THAT THEY CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON . THAT MEANS SKILLS AND TRAINING THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE FIND A JOB . AND THAT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD THAT ACTUALLY MAKE WORK PAY . I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS ECONOMIC AGENDA , BOTH IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF I SHOULD GET THE CHANCE TO UNKNOWNWORD THESE POLICIES AS YOUR PRESIDENT . I WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD IT WILL COME WITHOUT COST , BUT I DO BELIEVE WE CAN DO ACHIEVE THIS IN A UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBLE WAY - CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THAT'S GIVEN US UNKNOWNWORD AS FAR AS THE UNKNOWNWORD CAN SEE . I KNOW SOME MAY SAY IT'S UNKNOWNWORD TO COME TO WALL STREET AND CALL FOR SHARED SACRIFICE SO THAT ALL AMERICANS CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS NEW ECONOMY OF OURS . BUT I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE AS OPEN AND WILLING TO LISTEN AS ANYONE ELSE IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE YOU CARE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND THE FUTURE WE ARE LEAVING TO THE NEXT GENERATION . I BELIEVE YOUR WORK TO BE A PART OF BUILDING A STRONGER , MORE UNKNOWNWORD , AND MORE JUST AMERICA . I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE HAS ASKED YOU TO UNKNOWNWORD A PART IN THE PROJECT OF AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD . I ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF THIS IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT . THAT IT IS TOO HARD TO BUILD UNKNOWNWORD . THAT WE ARE TOO DIVIDED AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THINK ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO EACH OTHER AND TO OUR COUNTRY . THAT THE TIMES ARE SIMPLY TOO TOUGH . BUT THEN I AM UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN UNKNOWNWORD TIMES AND WE HAVE FACED FAR MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES . AND EACH TIME WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD STRONGER , MORE UNITED , AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN THE LAST . IT IS FAITH IN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT UNKNOWNWORD US THROUGH , AS WELL AS THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK : UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT AN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD ; AND IN THE STRENGTH OF GREAT HOPE WE MUST ALL UNKNOWNWORD OUR COMMON UNKNOWNWORD ." THAT IS THE STRENGTH AND THE HOPE WE SEEK BOTH TODAY - AND IN ALL THE DAYS AND MONTHS TO COME . 
RED	THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK BEFORE THE UNKNOWNWORD STATE REPUBLICANS AT YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . I STAND BEFORE YOU AT A UNKNOWNWORD TIME , A UNKNOWNWORD TIME FOR OUR PARTY BUT , FAR MORE IMPORTANT , A UNKNOWNWORD TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY . WE FACE AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY DEDICATED TO OUR DESTRUCTION . WE FACE CRITICISM AT HOME AND UNKNOWNWORD . SOME DOUBT THAT WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST OUR ENEMIES ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN EUROPE , THE AMERICAS , AFRICA , THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA . JUST THIS WEEK , TERRORIST PLOTS WERE UNCOVERED IN DENMARK AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS UNKNOWNWORD HOW SERIOUS THE THREAT IS , YET MUCH OF WASHINGTON REMAINS MIRED IN IRRESOLUTION AND DEFEATISM . THREE DECADES AGO , A VISIONARY POLITICIAN DESCRIBED THE DANGERS IN THE WORLD . IT WAS , LIKE TODAY , A TIME WHEN SOME DOUBTED AMERICA'S GOODNESS AND GREATNESS . MANY ARGUED FOR RECONCILIATION WITH OUR GLOBAL ADVERSARY . BUT THIS MAN HELD FIRM . HE DID NOT CARE WHAT EDITORIAL BOARDS WROTE ABOUT HIM . HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT . HE CRITICIZED THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ' FOREIGN POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION . HE CALLED FOR RESOLVE AND UNKNOWNWORD IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION . AND , HE REFUSED TO UNKNOWNWORD MILLIONS TO PERPETUAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FALSE HOPE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE SOVIET UNION WOULD UNKNOWNWORD TO AMERICA'S SECURITY . FORTUNATELY , THIS MAN , UNKNOWNWORD REAGAN , BECAME PRESIDENT REAGAN . HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE HAD HE NOT WON ELECTION IN UNKNOWNWORD AND 1984 ? DOES ANYONE BELIEVE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CALLED THE SOVIET UNION AN UNKNOWNWORD EMPIRE " OR WOULD HAVE STOOD UP TO THE NUCLEAR FREEZE MOVEMENT ? CAN YOU IMAGINE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT SAYING COMMUNISM SHOULD BE LEFT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD HEAP OF HISTORY , OR CALLING ON UNKNOWNWORD TO TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL ? WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS TRIED TO UNKNOWNWORD WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD AND FREEDOM UNKNOWNWORD , RONALD REAGAN WAS UNKNOWNWORD AND HE WAS RIGHT . THANKS TO HIS LEADERSHIP , THE SOVIET UNION UNKNOWNWORD AND THE COLD WAR WAS WON ON OUR TERMS . TODAY , THE CHALLENGES ARE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THEY WERE WHEN RONALD REAGAN STOOD UNKNOWNWORD . AND , TODAY , THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ARE EVERY BIT AS STARK AS THEY WERE UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE AGAINST FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS ENGAGED IN WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A WAR ON TERROR , OFFER TO ENTER INTO UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR WORST ENEMIES , AND TALK ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THE FORCES OF RADICALISM BY ADVOCATING SURRENDER TO THEM IN IRAQ . IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY IN IRAQ , IF WE CEDE IRAQ TO AL QAEDA , HOW LONG WILL THEY STAY THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN ? WE FACE GRAVE CHALLENGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST : HALTING IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS ; PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY , ISRAEL ; SUPPORTING MODERATE VOICES IN THE FACE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; DEFENDING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AGGRESSION . DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT IN IRAQ ? IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO THINK SO , AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO DOES ISN'T PREPARED TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY IN THE UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . THE WORLD RONALD REAGAN FACED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE UNKNOWNWORD HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH UNKNOWNWORD AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS MY FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT , AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT , THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO UNKNOWNWORD US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . AS WE MEET HERE TODAY , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND UNKNOWNWORD AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FORCES ' UNKNOWNWORD PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY UNKNOWNWORD MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD AND THE TERRIBLE UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD TO THESE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH WILL AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING SERIOUSLY UNKNOWNWORD THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . LIKE YOU , I WANT OUR TROOPS TO COME HOME , BUT I WANT THEM TO COME HOME WITH HONOR . THE HONOR OF VICTORY THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF THOSE W UNKNOWNWORD HAVE PAID WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD SACRIFICE SO THAT SACRIFICE IS NOT IN VAIN . WE HAVE NEW UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY THAT I HAVE CALLED FOR FROM THE BEGINNING , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS UNKNOWNWORD WHERE OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FAILED . UNKNOWNWORD THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNKNOWNWORD , WE MUST GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TIME TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR PAST UNKNOWNWORD A MEASURE OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT AS MANY LEADING DEMOCRATS NOW UNKNOWNWORD -- WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , UNKNOWNWORD IRAN AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY UNKNOWNWORD GENOCIDE THERE , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE ENTIRE UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD POWERS COME TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR FAVORED UNKNOWNWORD . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD UNKNOWNWORD DRAW US INTO A UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . LET ME BE CLEAR : UNKNOWNWORD TO LOSE IN IRAQ WOULD HAND A VICTORY TO THE UNKNOWNWORD IN CONTROL OF IRAN . AS IRAN'S PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WE WILL SEE A HUGE POWER UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ] WE ARE PREPARED TO FILL THE UNKNOWNWORD ." IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAR AGAINST OUR FORCES IN IRAQ FOR YEARS . THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH ADVANCED WEAPONS AND ON THE GROUND TRAINING . TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO , THE RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAN UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD HELD UNKNOWNWORD FOR MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD DAYS RATHER THAN FACE PRESIDENT REAGAN . IT WAS THE FIRST VICTORY OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WE SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD THE LESSON IT UNKNOWNWORD FOR DEALING WITH IRAN TODAY : DETERMINATION AND RESOLVE , NOT UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , ARE WHAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . RONALD REAGAN UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NEED FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNFORTUNATELY , WE DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD HIS WISDOM AND WE PAID A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR WEAKNESS AND UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD THE THREAT POSED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISM IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT TODAY , OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE EVEN MORE UNKNOWNWORD , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD IN IT . I WILL DO UNKNOWNWORD I CAN TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT UNKNOWNWORD ME UNKNOWNWORD TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE UNKNOWNWORD WE CAN SUCCEED ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF IRAQ AND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT IS TO USE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD I POSSESS , AND EVERY UNKNOWNWORD GOD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND UNKNOWNWORD POPULAR UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY UNKNOWNWORD AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A UNKNOWNWORD FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . UNKNOWNWORD WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION OF THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND UNKNOWNWORD CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE FOR US AND FOR THE WORLD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , RONALD REAGAN GAVE HIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CITY UPON A HILL " UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BY SAYING : UNKNOWNWORD CANNOT ESCAPE OUR UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD SHOULD WE TRY TO DO SO . THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FREE WORLD WAS UNKNOWNWORD UPON US IN THE LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND POWER OF AMERICA WAS ALL THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE RETURN TO THE UNKNOWNWORD AGES , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SAID , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT GENIUS FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . INTO THE HANDS OF AMERICA , GOD HAS PLACED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN UNKNOWNWORD MANKIND .' WE ARE INDEED , AND WE ARE TODAY , THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH ." IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO HEAR UNKNOWNWORD REAGAN DELIVER THAT UNKNOWNWORD . I HAD UNKNOWNWORD BEEN UNKNOWNWORD FROM A LONG UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HIS WORDS RING TRUE TODAY WHEN , ONCE AGAIN , IT FALLS TO AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST A GLOBAL THREAT AS THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD UNKNOWNWORD TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE UNKNOWNWORD OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU . 
RED	UNKNOWNWORD MORNING , AND THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF BEING HERE WITH YOU FOR THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I AM PROUD TO ADDRESS SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD GROUP OF PATRIOTS . UNKNOWNWORD AM HERE , IN PART , TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR SACRIFICE ON BEHALF OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . EVERY AMERICAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE TRUE UNKNOWNWORD OF FREEDOM , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT MUST BE PAID TO PRESERVE IT , UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD DEBT OF UNKNOWNWORD TO EACH YOU AND TO ALL OF THE BRAVE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD " YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO LEAD . THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE . UNKNOWNWORD WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY WHO MADE THEIR LIVING AT UNKNOWNWORD IN DEFENSE OF OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . MY GRANDFATHER WAS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ; MY FATHER A UNKNOWNWORD . THEIR RESPECT FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY LIFE . AND SO IT WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD FIND A PLACE IN MY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT UNKNOWNWORD WOULD ONE DAY TAKE ME TO WAR . UNKNOWNWORD WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF YOU . YOUR AMBITIONS MIGHT NOT HAVE LED YOU TO WAR ; THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU UNKNOWNWORD WERE NOT KEPT UNKNOWNWORD ON BATTLEFIELDS . MANY OF YOU WERE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU UNKNOWNWORD THE CALL WHEN IT CAME ; TOOK UP ARMS AND SERVED FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S SAKE ; AND FOUGHT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED AMERICA'S SECURITY WAS AS MUCH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS IT WAS THE PROFESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME , YOU BUILT A BETTER A COUNTRY THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED . UNKNOWNWORD DO NOT MEAN TO UNKNOWNWORD THE VIRTUES OF THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER . I UNKNOWNWORD MY UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR RANKS TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF MY LIFE . THE NAVY WAS AND STILL REMAINS THE WORLD I KNOW BEST AND LOVE MOST . "THE WORLD HAS CHANGED UNKNOWNWORD SINCE SEPTEMBER UNKNOWNWORD , 2001 . TODAY , THE NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD ROLE UNKNOWNWORD , IN MANY RESPECTS , THE ROLE IT UNKNOWNWORD IN WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN GUARD UNKNOWNWORD FOUGHT IN EVERY UNKNOWNWORD AND EVERY MAJOR CAMPAIGN . UNKNOWNWORD SUCH AS COMPANY A OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BOYS " OF THE VIRGINIA NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD 6 , UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TO 9/11 , A LOT OF US DIDN'T ALWAYS FULLY APPRECIATE THE POWER AND POTENTIAL OF THE GUARD , AND WHAT IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO . BUT MY FRIENDS , WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW . TIMES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ALL UNDERSTAND THAT NOW . UNKNOWNWORD , THOUSANDS OF NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND UNKNOWNWORD ONCE AGAIN FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON EVERY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WAR AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD ISLAM . FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AFGHANISTAN TO THE BACK UNKNOWNWORD OF IRAQ , GUARD AND RESERVE UNKNOWNWORD ARE ENGAGED IN EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND UNKNOWNWORD , TOGETHER WITH THE RESERVE FORCES , ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NEXT GREAT GENERATION . YOU ARE THE ROLE UNKNOWNWORD OF FREEDOM , WHO BRAVELY SET UNKNOWNWORD SELF-INTEREST , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HOME , THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF YOUR JOBS AND UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE COMPANY OF YOUR FAMILIES TO UNKNOWNWORD THE HARD WORK OF UNKNOWNWORD DO YOUR PART IN UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , PROTECTING OUR UNKNOWNWORD VALUES , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE LIFE AND PROPERTY OF FELLOW HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD , OFTEN BY UNKNOWNWORD YOUR OWN . "THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD UNKNOWNWORD THE VERY BEST OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN AND WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS UNKNOWNWORD ALL UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO UNKNOWNWORD IT AS THEIR UNKNOWNWORD DUTY NOT SIMPLY TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF UNKNOWNWORD , BUT TO ANSWER ITS OBLIGATIONS . UNKNOWNWORD MATTER THE UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR SECURITY OR UNKNOWNWORD HOME OR UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE VIOLENT UNKNOWNWORD OF FREEDOM OR THE UNKNOWNWORD FORCES OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHEREVER AND UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA HAS CALLED , THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS UNKNOWNWORD . YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN READY . YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE . UNKNOWNWORD EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD YOU ARE GUARD , UNKNOWNWORD , OR UNKNOWNWORD ARE DIFFICULT TIMES . WE ARE A NATION AT WAR , AND WE HAVE ASKED OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FORCES AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED UNKNOWNWORD OF COMMITMENT AND SACRIFICE . EXTENDED UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD HAVE BECOME THE UNKNOWNWORD RATHER THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THE FACE OF THESE DEMANDS , THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE GUARD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DISTINCTION THAT ONCE WAS SO UNKNOWNWORD NOW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IN 2005 , ARMY NATIONAL GUARD UNKNOWNWORD MADE UP MORE THAN 50 % OF THE COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ . NOT SINCE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE WE ASKED SO MUCH OF THE GUARD , NOT ONLY OVERSEAS BUT AT HOME WHERE THE GUARD MUST CONTINUE TO UNKNOWNWORD ITS CRITICAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE HOMELAND FROM ATTACK , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THREATEN LIVES AND PROPERTY ALMOST EVERY DAY . UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICA , TODAY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD , ARE CUT FROM THE SAME PATRIOTIC UNKNOWNWORD AS THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE CALL AT UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD HILL , UNKNOWNWORD AND COLD HARBOR , THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD ARE MEN LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNKNOWNWORD TWO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD FROM A UNKNOWNWORD AREA OF AFGHANISTAN UNKNOWNWORD WITH AL UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD FORCES . THE HELICOPTER TOOK HEAVY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . ULTIMATELY , SEVEN AMERICAN LIVES WERE LOST , BUT MANY MORE WERE UNKNOWNWORD , THANKS TO THE COURAGE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS OWN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HELPED ESTABLISH A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THEN UNKNOWNWORD THE WOUNDED , PROTECTED THEM FROM ENEMY UNKNOWNWORD , AND ESTABLISHED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD POINTS . BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ." THIS WAS A UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE SUCCESS OF HIS TEAM BY UNKNOWNWORD UP UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IT AMONG THOSE STILL ABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD SURE UNKNOWNWORD WEAPON WAS UNKNOWNWORD AND NO ONE WAS LEFT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD THE LIVES OF TEN UNKNOWNWORD WOUNDED AMERICANS . UNKNOWNWORD WERE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD AND TRUE UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FORCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OTHERS MAY LIVE ," AND ONE WHO FOLLOWED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL UNKNOWNWORD STATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD "THE WORLD IN WHICH MANY OF US SERVED IN THE PAST WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE UNKNOWNWORD HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH UNKNOWNWORD AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS OUR FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . UNKNOWNWORD , WE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO UNKNOWNWORD US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . UNKNOWNWORD WE MEET , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND UNKNOWNWORD AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FORCES ' UNKNOWNWORD PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY UNKNOWNWORD MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD AND THE TERRIBLE UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD TO THESE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH WILL . AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING . SERIOUSLY UNKNOWNWORD THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . UNKNOWNWORD THE COMING MONTH WE WILL FACE A UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ROAD . WE CAN PURSUE OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR VICTORY IN IRAQ , STRENGTHEN OUR HAND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS , AND MAKE OUR NATION MORE SECURE . OR WE CAN FOLD OUR UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD OUR ENEMIES , UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD INTO UNKNOWNWORD , AND INCREASE THE UNKNOWNWORD FACED ON OUR HOME UNKNOWNWORD . WHICH WAY UNKNOWNWORD GREATER LEADERSHIP ? I PLAN TO LEAD THE FIGHT IN SEPTEMBER ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS AND IN SUPPORT OF VICTORY AND AGAINST A PLAN FOR DEFEAT . UNKNOWNWORD HAVE NEW UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY THAT I HAVE UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS UNKNOWNWORD WHERE OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FAILED . UNKNOWNWORD THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNKNOWNWORD , WE MUST GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TIME TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR PAST UNKNOWNWORD A MEASURE OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT NOW WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , UNKNOWNWORD IRAN AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY UNKNOWNWORD GENOCIDE THERE , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE ENTIRE UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD POWERS COME TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR FAVORED UNKNOWNWORD . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD UNKNOWNWORD DRAW US INTO A UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . UNKNOWNWORD DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD IN IT . I WILL DO UNKNOWNWORD I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US .

BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT UNKNOWNWORD ME UNKNOWNWORD TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . UNKNOWNWORD HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE OTHERS . AND THAT IS TO USE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD I POSSESS , AND EVERY UNKNOWNWORD GOD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND UNKNOWNWORD POPULAR UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY UNKNOWNWORD AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD SO WE CAN DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . "THE NEW SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE WILL CONTINUE TO UNKNOWNWORD GREAT CHALLENGES , AND REQUIRE THAT WE USE ALL UNKNOWNWORD OF NATIONAL POWER TO DEFEAT RADICALISM . THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD ROLE IN THIS UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT , UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE ITS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BRING SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD RANGE OF SKILLS AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE FORCE . UNKNOWNWORD WE GO FORWARD , AMERICA MUST MAKE A NEW AND LASTING COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT THAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE FORCE IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , LED , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE GROWING UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD WE ASK OF YOU BOTH AT HOME AND UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT MUST BEGIN WITH OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF WHAT WE ASK GUARD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD WITH A FORCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD SOLDIERS AND UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD , GUARD AND RESERVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD IMPOSED ON OUR MILITARY . WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF FOLLOWING THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TO DO SO UNKNOWNWORD THE TRUST OF THOSE WHO SERVE , AND IS A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . "IT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE GUARD HAS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH WHICH TO UNKNOWNWORD AND DEPLOY . WE MUST NEVER , NEVER , ASK OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO GO INTO HARM'S WAY WITHOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB EFFECTIVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD THE ENEMY THEY FACE IS A MILITARY FORCE , TERRORIST CELL , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , OR UNKNOWNWORD . "IT MEANS THAT OUR NATION'S LEADERS MUST SET UNKNOWNWORD PRIORITIES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF NATIONAL RESOURCES . THE CONGRESS MUST STOP FUNDING UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD " AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER PORK BARREL UNKNOWNWORD WHILE WE SHORTCHANGE OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND FAIL TO PROVIDE WHAT THEY NEED TO DEFEND OUR NATION . "IT MEANS GETTING UNKNOWNWORD OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENT POLICIES , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT FAIL TO PROMOTE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FORCE BASED ON UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD RESPECT THAT ALL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE EARNED WITH THEIR BLOOD AND UNKNOWNWORD . IT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD A NEW UNKNOWNWORD WITH OUR GUARD AND RESERVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THEY HAVE THE PAY THEY DESERVE , THE UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITIES THEY UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SERVICE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR TIME , CAPABILITY , AND NEED . IT MEANS MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS , AND THEIR FAMILIES , RECEIVE THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED . IT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS ARE UNKNOWNWORD WITH EQUAL CARE AND UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , MY FRIENDS , IT MEANS A NATIONAL LEADERSHIP THAT RESPECTS AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD IN NATIONAL AND HOMELAND SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD , RATHER THAN AS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED PART OF THAT UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD THE CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE POSITION UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IT WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD AND IMPORTANCE OF ITS MISSION TODAY . UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD WILL REQUIRE BREAKING OLD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THINKING , AND UNDERSTANDING THE NEW UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE MODERN SECURITY ENVIRONMENT . IT WILL REQUIRE LESS PARTISANSHIP AND GREATER POLITICAL WILL . ABOVE ALL , IT DEMANDS STRONG LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY . UNKNOWNWORD GREAT CHALLENGES , EMERGE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES . OURS IS A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE . WITH IT COMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFER , THE WORLD BETTER , AND THE FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN DO THIS . WE CAN SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR GOOD AND THE GOOD OF OUR CHILDREN , BUT ONLY IF WE EXERCISE THE RESOLVE THAT AMERICA HAS ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD TIMES WHEN OUR SECURITY AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE WORLD'S FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE BALANCE . UNKNOWNWORD WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AS I UNKNOWNWORD SAYING THANK YOU .

UNKNOWNWORD YOU ." 
RED	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WARM WELCOME , AND FOR UNKNOWNWORD ME TO ADDRESS YOU . THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF UNKNOWNWORD AT YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . I'M ALWAYS GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY , AND PLEASED TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE HAD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN UNKNOWNWORD LANDS , AND THE HONOR OF HAVING UNKNOWNWORD YOUR PATRIOTISM IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES . I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY WHO MADE THEIR LIVING AT UNKNOWNWORD IN DEFENSE OF OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . MY GRANDFATHER WAS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ; MY FATHER A UNKNOWNWORD . THEIR RESPECT FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY LIFE . AND SO IT WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD FIND A PLACE IN MY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT UNKNOWNWORD WOULD ONE DAY TAKE ME TO WAR . SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF YOU . YOUR AMBITIONS MIGHT NOT HAVE LED YOU TO WAR ; THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU UNKNOWNWORD WERE NOT KEPT UNKNOWNWORD ON BATTLEFIELDS . MANY OF YOU WERE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU UNKNOWNWORD THE CALL WHEN IT CAME ; TOOK UP ARMS FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S SAKE ; AND FOUGHT TO THE LIMIT OF YOUR ABILITY BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED AMERICA'S SECURITY WAS AS MUCH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS IT WAS THE PROFESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME , YOU BUILT A BETTER A COUNTRY THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED . I DID WHAT I HAD PREPARED MUCH OF MY LIFE TO DO . YOU DID WHAT I DID AND MORE BUT WITHOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT I UNKNOWNWORD . MANY OF YOU WERE KIDS WHEN YOU SAW COMBAT . I WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD . I BELIEVE YOU UNKNOWNWORD ME . I DO NOT MEAN TO UNKNOWNWORD THE VIRTUES OF THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER . I UNKNOWNWORD MY UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR RANKS TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF MY LIFE . THE NAVY WAS AND STILL REMAINS THE WORLD I KNOW BEST AND LOVE MOST . THE NAVY TOOK ME TO WAR . UNKNOWNWORD YOU ARE A UNKNOWNWORD YOU MIGHT FIND IT UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE NAVY FOR SENDING ME TO WAR . YOU MIGHT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD VETERANS SHARE IS THAT WE ENJOYED WAR . BUT AS MOST VETERANS KNOW , WAR IS AN EXPERIENCE WE WOULD NOT TRADE AND WE WOULD RATHER NOT UNKNOWNWORD . WE DO SHARE A UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IT IS NOT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR . WAR IS AWFUL . WHEN NATIONS SEEK TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES BY FORCE OF ARMS , A MILLION UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . NOTHING , NOT THE UNKNOWNWORD WITH WHICH IT IS FOUGHT UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE CAUSE IT UNKNOWNWORD , CAN UNKNOWNWORD WAR . WAR IS UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND ALL UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD , IT IS LOSS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MOST UNKNOWNWORD . ONLY A UNKNOWNWORD OR A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE CRUEL AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR . NEITHER DO WE SHARE UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF COMBAT . THAT UNKNOWNWORD , AFTER ALL , IS REALLY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD BACK FEAR . WE MIGHT BE PROUD TO HAVE OVERCOME THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TERROR . BUT FEW OF US ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE EXPERIENCE TO MISTAKE IT TODAY FOR A WELCOME UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT WE SHARE IS SOMETHING HARDER TO UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS IN PART UNKNOWNWORD FOR HAVING SACRIFICED FOR A CAUSE GREATER THAN OURSELVES ; RELIEF FOR HAVING YOUR COURAGE AND HONOR TESTED AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CRUCIBLE OF COMBAT ; PRIDE FOR HAVING REPLACED UNKNOWNWORD AND SECURITY WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND NOT BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY THE EXPERIENCE . BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE SHARE , THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT IS OURS ALONE IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS WHO HAVE NOT SHARED OUR EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND . IF YOU WILL UNKNOWNWORD A FEW UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM A UNKNOWNWORD I WROTE IN A BOOK UNKNOWNWORD LAST WEEK , UNKNOWNWORD , HARD CALL , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND HOW AND WHY THEY WERE MADE . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD IN BETTER UNKNOWNWORD EVERYWHERE AND AT UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD , A BARGAIN AT TWICE THE UNKNOWNWORD . COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY UNKNOWNWORD , I UNKNOWNWORD THE BOOK BECAUSE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD I TRIED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MY UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT WAR ; ITS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT ARE OFTEN MADE ; THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SUCCESSFUL UNKNOWNWORD , THE EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD PURPOSE THAT IS THE COMBAT VETERAN'S . IT IS THE LAST UNKNOWNWORD THAT INTERESTED ME AS I TRIED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WAS THE WHITE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CIVIL WAR , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS HE HAD THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THE END , ALL SOLDIERS FIGHT FOR THE SAME CAUSE . SOME DEFEND THE RIGHT AND SOME THE UNKNOWNWORD . SOME UNKNOWNWORD THE CAUSE THEIR NATION SUMMONED THEM TO FIGHT . SOME UNKNOWNWORD OTHER INTERESTS OF THE STATE IN THEIR SUMMONS , LESS NOBLE OR SELFLESS PERHAPS , BUT SERVE OUT OF A SENSE OF PATRIOTIC DUTY . SOME FIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS AND PROUD TO DO THE JOB THEY HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD TO DO . SOME FIGHT TO UNKNOWNWORD THEMSELVES OR TO UNKNOWNWORD AN INJURY TO THEIR COUNTRY'S HONOR OR THEIR OWN . SOME FIGHT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD NOT TO OR TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGE AND UNKNOWNWORD OF COMBAT . SOME FIGHT TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER AND SOME TO KEEP THE WORLD FROM UNKNOWNWORD THEIR LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD OF IT . SOME FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD AND SOME UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UPHEAVAL OF WAR , THAT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND DISTINCTION , THINGS CHANGE . WAR IS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO FIND TRUTH , SOME OF IT UNKNOWNWORD , SOME OF IT UNKNOWNWORD BEAUTIFUL ; TO FIND UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHERE WE NEVER EXPECTED THEM TO UNKNOWNWORD . NO OTHER HUMAN EXPERIENCE EXISTS ON THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD IRONY THAT WAR , FOR ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IT UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD THE SOLDIER WITH EVERY UNKNOWNWORD HUMAN EXPERIENCE . EXPERIENCES THAT UNKNOWNWORD TAKE A LIFETIME TO KNOW ARE ALL FELT , AND FELT UNKNOWNWORD , IN ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF LIFE . ANYONE WHO UNKNOWNWORD A LOVED ONE KNOWS WHAT GREAT SORROW UNKNOWNWORD LIKE . AND ANYONE WHO UNKNOWNWORD LIFE TO A CHILD KNOWS WHAT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LIKE . THE COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD KNOWS WHAT GREAT LOSS AND GREAT UNKNOWNWORD FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE SAME MOMENT , THE SAME EXPERIENCE . IT CAN BE TRANSFORMING . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE CAUSE UNKNOWNWORD , UNION , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IT DOES NOT UNKNOWNWORD THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR . WAR UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHETHER THEY ARE GENUINE AND WORTHY OR SOMETHING LESS . WAR HAS ITS OWN UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF UNKNOWNWORD CAN BE FOUND IN WAR , IT IS A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE DECENCY AND LOVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AWFUL UNKNOWNWORD , IN UNKNOWNWORD SUFFERING , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE UNKNOWNWORD TO SOMETHING UNKNOWNWORD THAN OURSELVES , THAT OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TESTED , INJURED , AND CHANGED BY WAR IS NOT OUR ONLY UNKNOWNWORD POSSESSION . THAT SOMETHING IS NOT AN IDEAL BUT A COMMUNITY , A UNKNOWNWORD OF ARMS . SOLDIERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEIR WAR IS FOUGHT AND FOR WHICH THEY WILL UNKNOWNWORD DOWN THEIR LIVES . BUT IT IS THEIR WAR , AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , DESTRUCTION , AND UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR , SOLDIERS ARE UNKNOWNWORD BY DUTY AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE TO UNKNOWNWORD AND OVERCOME . THEIR STRONGEST UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT CANNOT BREAK , IS TO THE CAUSE THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD ALONE , THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY ALL FIGHT : ONE ANOTHER . IT IS THROUGH UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN ARMS , THEIR UNKNOWNWORD PRIVILEGE , THAT THEY SERVE THE NATIONAL IDEAL THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PERSONAL UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN WAR IS OVER , THEY MIGHT HAVE THE UNKNOWNWORD BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE SUCCESS OF THEIR NATION'S CAUSE . BUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL UNKNOWNWORD , ALL UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE CRUCIBLE IN WHICH IT WAS WON . FROM THAT CRUCIBLE THEY HAVE BUT ONE PRIZE , ONE HONOR , ONE UNKNOWNWORD : THAT THEY HAD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR AND WERE FOUND WORTHY BY THE MEN WHO STOOD WITH THEM ." THAT IS A DISTINCTION NO OTHER AMERICANS CAN UNKNOWNWORD , AND IT CAME AT A GREAT UNKNOWNWORD . THE SACRIFICES MADE BY VETERANS DESERVE TO BE UNKNOWNWORD IN SOMETHING MORE LASTING THAN UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD OR IN THE UNKNOWNWORD EFFECT OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TO DUTY HAVE EARNED YOUR COUNTRY'S ABIDING CONCERN FOR YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD TO HONOR THE COUNTRY'S DEBTS TO YOU , IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD UPON AMERICA'S HONOR . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I HOPE , NOT JUST GOVERNMENT BUT THE PUBLIC WHO ELECTED IT , TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO UNKNOWNWORD LIFE AND UNKNOWNWORD TO MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO US . SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD IS UNWORTHY OF THE UNKNOWNWORD NATION ON EARTH . AS THE UNKNOWNWORD LEADERS IN OUR HISTORY , GEORGE WASHINGTON AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , INSTRUCTED US , CARE FOR AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT TO DEFEND US SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD AMONG THE HIGHEST OF NATIONAL PRIORITIES . THE WORLD IN WHICH MANY OF US SERVED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE UNKNOWNWORD HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH UNKNOWNWORD AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS OUR FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT , AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT , THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO UNKNOWNWORD US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . AS WE MEET , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND UNKNOWNWORD AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FORCES ' UNKNOWNWORD PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY UNKNOWNWORD MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD AND THE TERRIBLE UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD TO THESE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH WILL AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING SERIOUSLY UNKNOWNWORD THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . WE HAVE NEW UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FROM THE BEGINNING , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS UNKNOWNWORD WHERE OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FAILED . UNKNOWNWORD THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNKNOWNWORD , WE MUST GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TIME TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR PAST UNKNOWNWORD A MEASURE OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT NOW WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , UNKNOWNWORD IRAN AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY UNKNOWNWORD GENOCIDE THERE , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE ENTIRE UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD POWERS COME TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR FAVORED UNKNOWNWORD . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DRAW US INTO A UNKNOWNWORD AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD IN IT . I WILL DO UNKNOWNWORD I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT UNKNOWNWORD ME UNKNOWNWORD TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT IS TO USE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD I POSSESS , AND EVERY UNKNOWNWORD GOD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND UNKNOWNWORD POPULAR UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY UNKNOWNWORD AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A UNKNOWNWORD FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . YOU KNOW THAT , YOU HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . UNKNOWNWORD WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION OF THE BEST AMERICANS , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND UNKNOWNWORD CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE . MANY OF THEM HAVE SERVED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN . MANY HAVE HAD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD EXTENDED . MANY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO COMBAT SOONER THAN THEY HAD BEEN LED TO EXPECT . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD AND HARD THING TO ASK SO MUCH MORE OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE ALREADY GIVEN MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY . FEW OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE NEWS ABOUT ADDITIONAL AND LONGER UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD A FEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PEOPLE LIKE ME , WHO HELPED MAKE THE DECISION TO SEND THEM THERE . AND THEN THEY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD EVERYTHING EVERYTHING TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR MISSION , TO PROTECT ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD FREEDOM AND OUR OWN COUNTRY FROM HARM . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY SERVED BY THEM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD UNKNOWNWORD TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE UNKNOWNWORD OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE OUR INSPIRATION , AS I UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF YOU WERE ONCE UNKNOWNWORD . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU .

RED	UNKNOWNWORD YOU FOR THE HONOR OF UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE THIS UNKNOWNWORD , AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL . YOUR EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TODAY MORE THAN EVER , AS IT IS HARDER TO THINK OF A TIME IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHEN UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL SECURITY HAS FACED SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGES . "THE UNKNOWNWORD STATE HAS , OF COURSE , EXPERIENCED TOUGH TIMES BEFORE - INDEED , THEY HAVE PERHAPS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD RATHER THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN ONE UNKNOWNWORD BACK OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD - UNKNOWNWORD , THE SIX DAY WAR , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD WAR , TWO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN - IT IS CLEAR THAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD MORE , IN LESS TIME , THAN ANY NATION ON EARTH . UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FACE OF SUCH UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD ; UNKNOWNWORD WOULD SEEM OUT OF THE QUESTION . UNKNOWNWORD ISRAEL HAS UNKNOWNWORD . I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY AMERICA , UNKNOWNWORD NATURAL PARTNER AND ALLY , AND BY ITS SUPPORTERS HERE AND THE WORLD OVER - UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF WHICH ARE HERE TODAY . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD CONTINUE - WITH HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH , IN THE UNKNOWNWORD SO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ARAB UNKNOWNWORD , IN THE UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE IN IRAQ AND UNKNOWNWORD , AND IN THE UNKNOWNWORD THREATS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT . UNKNOWNWORD ISRAEL WILL UNKNOWNWORD . JUST AS IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND TERRORISTS , JUST AS IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE MOST DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD ON EARTH , SO WILL IT SUCCEED IN THE FACE OF TODAY'S THREATS . THERE WILL ALWAYS , ALWAYS BE AN ISRAEL . UNKNOWNWORD JUST AS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PROUD , STRONG ISRAEL , SO TOO WILL THERE ALWAYS BE A CLOSE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RELATIONSHIP . WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL , WE SIMPLY CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD . IN VIEW OF THE INCREASED THREATS TO UNKNOWNWORD SECURITY , AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD - TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD NEEDED MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD AND TECHNOLOGY AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT ISRAEL UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD MILITARY EDGE . UNKNOWNWORD ENEMIES ARE TOO UNKNOWNWORD , ITS MARGIN OF UNKNOWNWORD TOO SMALL , AND OUR SHARED INTERESTS AND VALUES TOO GREAT FOR ANY OTHER POSITION . UNKNOWNWORD STRENGTH WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST . THE WORLD'S CHIEF STATE UNKNOWNWORD OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM , IRAN , UNKNOWNWORD ITSELF BY UNKNOWNWORD TO ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES . IT IS SIMPLY TRAGIC THAT UNKNOWNWORD OF PROUD UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IN A GOVERNMENT TODAY THAT CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD AMONG THOSE OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS . WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN CALLS FOR ISRAEL TO BE UNKNOWNWORD OFF OF THE MAP , OR UNKNOWNWORD FOR A WORLD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD , OR UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RETURN TO EUROPE , OR CALLS THE HOLOCAUST A UNKNOWNWORD , IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AN EVIL MAN AND A VERY DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD CONTINUED UNKNOWNWORD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD POSES AN UNKNOWNWORD RISK . PROTECTED BY A NUCLEAR ARSENAL , IRAN WOULD FEEL UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ANY UNKNOWNWORD ENEMY . ITS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD TREATY WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND COULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , SAUDI UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHERS TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEFENSE UNKNOWNWORD .

IN THE UNKNOWNWORD , THE U.S . SHOULD IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER ANY OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE TERMS OF LAST UNKNOWNWORD IRAN FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT . "THE U.S . SHOULD ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THE SANCTIONS EFFORT BY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD CAMPAIGN . BY UNKNOWNWORD INDIVIDUALS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN , WE CAN ISOLATE AND UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT . WE WILL ALSO , AS WE DID WITH THE SOUTH AFRICA UNKNOWNWORD CAMPAIGN , INCREASE THE UNKNOWNWORD INSIDE THE COUNTRY ABOUT WHETHER THE UNKNOWNWORD COURSE UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERESTS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE OR MERELY THOSE OF A MISGUIDED UNKNOWNWORD .

UNKNOWNWORD EVERY UNKNOWNWORD MUST UNKNOWNWORD ON THE TABLE . MILITARY ACTION ISN'T OUR UNKNOWNWORD . IT REMAINS , AS IT ALWAYS MUST , THE LAST UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE SOME WAY TO GO UNKNOWNWORD BEFORE WE NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IT IS A SIMPLE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN A MILITARY SOLUTION , AND THAT , MY FRIENDS , IS A NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD IRAN . THE UNKNOWNWORD MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IT CANNOT WIN A UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE WORLD . UNKNOWNWORD , THE LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE ARE UNKNOWNWORD BY A UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD TO RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD RIGHT TO UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PEACE UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNITED STATES CANNOT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD RELATIONS WITH SUCH A GOVERNMENT , ONE THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD INNOCENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . "THE UNKNOWNWORD TALKS BETWEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT LED BY PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WEST UNKNOWNWORD ARE ENCOURAGING , AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT . WE ALSO MUST UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL A UNKNOWNWORD LEADERSHIP UNKNOWNWORD COMMITTED TO PEACE UNKNOWNWORD . NO MORAL NATION - NEITHER ISRAEL UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA - CAN ALLOW TERRORISTS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE POLITICAL COURSE OF ITS PEOPLE . UNKNOWNWORD TO SPEAK OF TERRORISM IS ALSO TO SPEAK OF HEZBOLLAH . UNKNOWNWORD CHANCE FOR UNKNOWNWORD PEACE WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS A UNKNOWNWORD ON AUTHORITY WITHIN ITS COUNTRY . THAT MEANS NO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , NO HEZBOLLAH UNKNOWNWORD , NO WEAPONS AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO HEZBOLLAH . YET NEITHER THE LEBANESE ARMY UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERNATIONAL FORCE THERE IS PREPARED OR WILLING TO TAKE ON HEZBOLLAH . SO LONG AS THAT IS THE CASE , THE CURRENT UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD TO ENABLE HEZBOLLAH TO REGROUP , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . THERE IS ONE UNKNOWNWORD LINE : TO ACHIEVE LASTING PEACE , SOONER OR LATER , ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , HEZBOLLAH MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD LET ME TURN UNKNOWNWORD TO IRAQ . WE HAVE MADE A GREAT MANY UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS WAR , AND BOTH BAGHDAD AND WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD DIVIDED ABOUT HOW TO UNKNOWNWORD THEM . THE UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ IS VERY DIFFICULT , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD IS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR HANDS OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . TO FOLLOW THIS UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FOR IRAQ , ISRAEL , AND THE UNITED STATES . UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL WAR AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A FAILED STATE IN THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST , UNKNOWNWORD INTERVENTION FROM UNKNOWNWORD NEIGHBORS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE MUST DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS MEANS SUPPORTING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS HE UNKNOWNWORD OUR TROOPS IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DESIGNED TO CLEAR AREAS OF TERRORISTS AND BRING SECURITY TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . IT ALSO MEANS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT TO MAKE POLITICAL PROGRESS , WHICH HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT MUST SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD IT BY THE UNKNOWNWORD " IN U.S . FORCES AND MAKE BOLD UNKNOWNWORD ON RECONCILIATION . IT WILL NOT COME AROUND AGAIN . UNKNOWNWORD IRAQ FROM UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS IS ONLY NATURAL FOR THE UNITED STATES , AND UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE SAME INTERESTS AND VALUES THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL . VIOLENT ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE ACCEPTABLE RELIGIOUS UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD FROM IT ARE NOT UNKNOWNWORD TO LIFE OR UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD , VERY , VERY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD FOR ANYTHING , IT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE FREEDOM TO FOLLOW OUR OWN MINDS AND HEARTS , TO DETERMINE OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD . I DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD JUST HOW UNKNOWNWORD THIS FREEDOM IS UNTIL IT WAS TAKEN AWAY . AS SOME IN THIS AUDIENCE MAY KNOW , I SPENT UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AS A UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR , A TIME WHEN ALL MY UNKNOWNWORD WERE UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET IT WAS MY VERY FAITH IN A SUPREME BEING THAT UNKNOWNWORD ME AND UNKNOWNWORD ME WHILE AT THE HANDS OF MY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BUILT IN THIS NATION AN UNKNOWNWORD THING - A DEMOCRACY THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE RIGHT OF EVERY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD GOD IN THE WAY THAT THEY CHOOSE . WE MUST PROTECT THAT FREEDOM HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY BY UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD DO NOT UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE MUST SUPPORT ITS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BY STANDING WITH THOSE WHOM , BECAUSE OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AND THEIR VALUES , COME UNDER THREAT . "IT IS EVIDENT THAT I AM UNKNOWNWORD , ONCE AGAIN , OF ISRAEL . THE UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN AMERICA AND ISRAEL IS NOT JUST A STRATEGIC ONE , THOUGH THAT IS IMPORTANT . THE MORE PROFOUND UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IS A MORAL ONE . WE ARE TWO UNKNOWNWORD WHOSE ALLIANCE IS UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR COMMON VALUES . TO BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT TO HOLD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS ABOUT DEFENDING THE PRINCIPLES THAT BOTH COUNTRIES HOLD DEAR . THAT IS WHY TODAY I STAND AS I BELIEVE SO MANY OF YOU DO : A UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ." 
RED	UNKNOWNWORD .

THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNKNOWNWORD , THE VOTE WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE , HAS NEVER BEEN IN DOUBT TO A SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS BODY . AND TO STATE THE OBVIOUS , NOTHING WE HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST UNKNOWNWORD HOURS WILL HAVE CHANGED ANY UNKNOWNWORD ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ OR MADE THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR ANY MORE OR LESS IMPORTANT TO THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY . THE STAKES IN THIS WAR UNKNOWNWORD AS HIGH TODAY AS THEY WERE YESTERDAY ; THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT ARE JUST AS GRAVE ; THE COSTS OF SUCCESS JUST AS DEAR . NO BATTLE WILL HAVE BEEN WON OR LOST , NO ENEMY WILL HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD , NO GROUND WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR UNKNOWNWORD , NO SOLDIER WILL HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OR BEEN WOUNDED , UNKNOWNWORD OR COME HOME BECAUSE WE SPENT AN ENTIRE NIGHT UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD MESSAGE POINTS , UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WITH EACH OTHER , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . ALL WE HAVE ACHIEVED ARE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD SENSE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS UNKNOWNWORD AND OUR OWN UNKNOWNWORD PHYSICAL UNKNOWNWORD . TOMORROW THE UNKNOWNWORD WILL MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS AND WE WILL BE BETTER UNKNOWNWORD . BUT NOTHING ELSE WILL HAVE CHANGED . UNKNOWNWORD IRAQ , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE STILL FIGHTING BRAVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND UNKNOWNWORD AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FORCES ' UNKNOWNWORD PAST . OUR ENEMIES WILL STILL BE UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD US , AND USING OUR DEFEAT TO ENCOURAGE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN THE JIHAD THEY WAGE AGAINST US , A WAR WHICH WILL BECOME A GREATER THREAT TO US SHOULD WE UNKNOWNWORD THE CENTRAL UNKNOWNWORD IN DEFEAT . THE MIDDLE EAST WILL STILL BE A UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH OUR DEFEAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAR THAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD INTERESTS AT RISK THERE AND DRAW US INTO A LONGER AND FAR MORE UNKNOWNWORD WAR . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF GENOCIDE IN IRAQ , IN WHICH WE WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IS STILL AS REAL A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD TODAY AS IT WAS YESTERDAY . UNKNOWNWORD OUR EXTENDED UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS , I HAVE HEARD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CERTAIN UNKNOWNWORD OVER AND OVER AGAIN . MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF US WHO OPPOSE THIS UNKNOWNWORD WITH ADVOCATING UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE ," WHICH IS UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD ON CONTINUING THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAVE PUT THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR IN DOUBT . YET WE ALL KNOW THAT WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE CHANGED COURSE . WE ARE NOW FIGHTING A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY , WHICH SOME OF US HAVE ARGUED WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FROM THE BEGINNING , AND WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS UNKNOWNWORD WHERE OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE FAILED , UNKNOWNWORD THE OUTCOME REMAINS FAR FROM CERTAIN . THE UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSED IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OFFERED BY MY FRIENDS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD - A UNKNOWNWORD FORCE , UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD , FROM WHERE THEY WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND DESTROY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THE IRAQI MILITARY - ARE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR MOST OF THIS WAR AND WHICH HAVE , BY UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT , FAILED UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , THAT , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , IS UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE , AND IT IS A COURSE THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR DEFEAT AND THE UNKNOWNWORD CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAQ , THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES OUR DEFEAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD , WE HAVE HEARD QUITE A LOT ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE ," THOUGH THE REAL OUTCOME SHOULD THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND BE UNKNOWNWORD INTO LAW , WOULD BE TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND THE AMERICANS THEY HAVE THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD THE ABILITY TO TRY , IN THIS LATE HOUR , TO ADDRESS THE UNKNOWNWORD THESE TRIED AND FAILED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FAILURES A MEASURE OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . UNKNOWNWORD HAVE ALSO UNKNOWNWORD TO MY UNKNOWNWORD ON THE OTHER SIDE UNKNOWNWORD REMIND US THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE LAST ELECTION . THEY HAVE DEMANDED WE UNKNOWNWORD FROM IRAQ , AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO , AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE , WHAT THEY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD US TO DO . BUT IS THAT OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY ? REALLY , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , IS THAT HOW WE UNKNOWNWORD OUR ROLE : TO FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION POPULAR UNKNOWNWORD EVEN IF WE BELIEVE IT TO BE IN UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO DEFEND ? UNKNOWNWORD , WE MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ELECTED US TO OFFICE , AND WHO , IF IT IS THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , WILL UNKNOWNWORD US WHEN THEY BECOME UNKNOWNWORD WITH OUR UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEMANDS . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . AND I UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE BECOME SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WAR , GIVEN THE MANY , MANY UNKNOWNWORD MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY LEADERS IN ITS UNKNOWNWORD . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THESE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE TERRIBLE UNKNOWNWORD WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT I CANNOT UNKNOWNWORD TO THESE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE OF ACTION THAT I KNOW WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH WILL -- AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING - SERIOUSLY UNKNOWNWORD THE PEOPLE I UNKNOWNWORD AND THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PEOPLE OF UNKNOWNWORD , AND TO ALL AMERICANS . I TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , OR TRY TO . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE OTHERS - AND THAT IS TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER , TO USE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD I UNKNOWNWORD , AND EVERY UNKNOWNWORD GOD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , EVEN IF I MUST STAND UNKNOWNWORD POPULAR UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD MY REASONS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY UNKNOWNWORD AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A UNKNOWNWORD FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR , THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY UNKNOWNWORD AND MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I UNKNOWNWORD IT TODAY . AND IT IS HOW I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . UNKNOWNWORD CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT I POSSESS THE SKILLS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD . I CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT EVEN IF I COULD CONVINCE AMERICANS TO GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE TIME HE NEEDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD , THAT WE WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ . ALL I AM CERTAIN OF IS THAT OUR DEFEAT THERE WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND THAT I CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD IN IT , BUT MUST DO UNKNOWNWORD I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP US TRY TO AVERT IT . THAT , UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , IS ALL I CAN POSSIBLY OFFER MY COUNTRY AT THIS TIME . IT IS NOT MUCH UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT , AND AM HUMBLED BY IT , AS WE ALL ARE . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT UNKNOWNWORD ME UNKNOWNWORD TO SAY TO MY UNKNOWNWORD AND TO ALL AMERICANS WHO UNKNOWNWORD WITH ME : THAT AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . UNKNOWNWORD AM PRIVILEGED , AS WE ALL ARE , TO BE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HISTORY . BUT , MY FRIENDS , THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME JUDGMENT . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE PEOPLE WILL UNKNOWNWORD LONG BEFORE UNKNOWNWORD . I AM UNKNOWNWORD TO EVER KNOW HOW HISTORY HAS UNKNOWNWORD US IN THIS HOUR . THE UNKNOWNWORD JUDGMENT OF ME I WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH . I WILL ACCEPT IT , AS I MUST . BUT WHETHER IT IS UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL STAND WHERE I STAND , AND TAKE UNKNOWNWORD FROM MY CONFIDENCE THAT I TOOK MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO MY COUNTRY SERIOUSLY , AND DESPITE THE UNKNOWNWORD I HAVE MADE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT AND THE UNKNOWNWORD I HAVE AS AN UNKNOWNWORD , I TRIED AS BEST I COULD TO HELP THE COUNTRY WE ALL LOVE UNKNOWNWORD AS SAFE AS SHE COULD BE IN AN HOUR OF SERIOUS PERIL ."
